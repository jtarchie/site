# Hello, World!

I wrote my own blog engine. Mainly because I wanted to, the other ones are just
fine.

When using it locally, it watches the content and rebuilds it. The browser still
requires a manual refresh, but that's alright. It requires `ruby`.

It builds the site specifically for Github Pages. The `CNAME` file is customized
for this site.

All the posts are in the `posts` directory. They are all timestamp
`YYYYMMDD.md`. The title used for navigation will always be single header `#`.

It can do fancy markdown things.

Source code rendering for `ruby`:

```ruby
puts "Hello, World"
```

## Smaller header

~~don't worry about it~~
