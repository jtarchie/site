# Testing Thoughts

When it comes to testing, the simplest explanation I've heard of tests, "Users
use our code through the web, console, and other user interfaces. Tests are
another interface just for the developers." Tests provide the developers
confidence that things are working the way they should.

> What does it mean to be red then green?

I always remember "red, green, then refactor" when I write a test.

1. Red -- An assertion (in the test) was made on the code's behavior, failing.
2. Green -- Write the code to make that tests pass. Now you have something in a
   working state. Commit it!
3. Refactor -- Now that you know things are in a working and deliverable state,
   can you refactor your code?

Do you need to do this each time? No.

It is helpful for me. It helps me narrow down the scope of a test and have a
criteria for when I am _done_ with it.

> Is your test testing just your test or your code?

We are setting up a situation.

There is a test, some code was written, and everything is green. Someone comes
back, edits some code, all the tests are still green.

In practice, this is great. Tests should have to change with a different
implementation of code, just as long as the assertions of the behavior is the
same.

If you comment out your code, what happens? Your test should fail. But it might
be passing, too. Why is that?

Sometimes our tests are just testing our tests, not our code. For example, we
might be testing a mock implementation of something.

I think about it this way. I expect some tests to fail when I comment out this
code. It may not be the tests I wrote, but something should break, so we know
something changed.

When writing tests, I like to think of the happy path first, "If everything was
working perfectly, what would I expect to happen?" Allowing you to write tests
free from the distractions of errors and side effects. It can help with test
setup the behavior you want the tests.

The next step is a sad path -- errors, side effects, and other paths. For
example, "If we cannot connect to the API, what should we do?" It helps test the
_branching_ (conditions) of your code.
