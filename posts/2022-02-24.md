# LinkedIn Post: Recuriters

There are two types of recruiters.

1. Provide useful information about the job, salary, company, benefits, etc.
   because it’s in their best interest to help you faster because they know you
   are getting spammed.
2. “I’ve provided you nothing, interested in discussing the position?”

One I always reply back to because they made an effort. The other I block.
