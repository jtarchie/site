# Tech debt is Team debt

Working on a product team always has two primary goals. Figuring out what you
are building and when can you deliver those features. Optmially, the team keeps
up the velocity of delivery indefinetly.

As an engineer, as you've been delivering, something irks you. Features start
become harder to deliver. There’s an refactoring you’ve been neglecting. Then it
occurs, you cannot keep delivering as you once were.

You’ve reach the imaginary line of technical debt.

Often we’ll look for scapegoat.

- A former engineer that use to be on the team.
- Too much work and not enough time because leaders have a deadline
- The one I dread hearing the most, “The product manager won’t let me.”

I assure you, it is your fault. A product manager has never looked over your
shoulder or pull request and said, “You do tech debt, now.” It is your fault,
but it is OK.

Tech debt is an unapproachable thing. With product delivery, we've accepted that
we won’t ever have a finished product, but will iterate over it. Tech debt still
is this bucket of “it’ll never be finished, so save it for _later_”. We need to
refrain from this phrase to not have the negative connotation it has.

We need to be better gardeners — code is the garden. If we prune, replant, etc.
the garden will grown into something nice. It has to be done while gardening,
though. Not at one big “you’ll have a hack day for tech debt” kind of way.
