# Hello, World!

I wrote my own blog engine.
Mainly because I wanted to, the other ones are just fine.

When using it locally, it watches the content and rebuilds it.
The browser still requires a manual refresh, but that's alright.
It requires `ruby`.

It builds the site specifically for Github Pages.
The `CNAME` file is customized for this site.

All the posts are in the `posts` directory.
They are all timestamp `YYYYMMDD.md`.
The title used for navigation will always be single header `#`.

It can do fancy markdown things.

Source code rendering for `ruby`: 

```ruby
puts "Hello, World"
```

## Smaller header

~~don't worry about it~~
