# When in San Diego

I've had some friends move to San Diego. Since I used to live there, this is a
list of things to do and try.

- 🛣Coastal Highway 101, drive it from Carlsbad down to San Diego.
- Drive to Torrey Pines, both South and North. It is just beautiful.

## Downtown

- 🍩[Donut Bar](https://goo.gl/maps/TvzidGvVLwUQhqZP7) is excellent. I love
  donuts and this place has never done wrong in providing something unique.
- 🥮[Extraordinary Desserts](https://goo.gl/maps/Am2HRpEPFyjPaRDMA) has a menu of
  just desserts. You may see a pattern here.
- 🌻[Balboa Park](https://goo.gl/maps/MA8FzMjvaGviTr3E7) is a beautiful botanical
  park. You can spend a day here, between the museums and gardens.
- 🦓[San Diego Zoo](https://goo.gl/maps/nGLYh58XAgr1vEz49) is the world-famous
  Zoo. Huge! All the animals! And located in Balboa Park.

## Breweries 🍺🍻

This deserved its own section. These breweries are spread amongst San Diego.
Always ask the brewer/tender where to go next, they know more.

- [Modern Times](https://goo.gl/maps/7XzSgLuQBasaRmXT8) great experimental
  brewery. Always something clever on tap. Similar to Something Brewery in
  Brighton, CO.
- Stone runs [Stone Gardens](https://goo.gl/maps/Nf6BUG6zVCkHzRsD8) Brewing.
  They have great location downtown and some of the best IPAs ever.
- [Resident Brewing](https://goo.gl/maps/heg97DFVNgmSAnPv6) has a great downtown
  SD location.

## Pacific Beach (PB) 🏴‍☠️

A surf "college" town, but lots of food, drinks, etc. Grand Ave is the "main
street", but the beauty of PB is the beach.

Fact: You used to be able to drink on the beach (like with kegs), until 2007
where the fight between July 4th beach party-goers and Police broke out.

- 🍔[Kono's Cafe](https://goo.gl/maps/MJQfYwVKPjtzzv8s6) is a "Hawaiian"
  breakfast spot. It is delicious. A tried-and-true hangover recovery area. It
  is also at the start of the PB boardwalk.
- PB Boardwalk, rent a bike (or bring one) and ride up and down. There are
  [characters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn87-mcnoVc) along here, but it
  can be very entertaining.
- 🏄‍♀️[Mission Beach Surfing](https://goo.gl/maps/uxWHo1LG4rVdkQUS9) is where I
  learned to surf. Every one fun and friendly. The water will be cold, it is the
  Pacific.
- 🖼[Green Flash Art](https://goo.gl/maps/FHetyMe9iQRXRPmx6) is a piece made to
  represent the sunset. The lore of it, when looking at the sunset, you see a
  green flash amongst the orange and red at the very end of it.
- [Fig Tree Cafe](https://g.page/figtreecafe-pacific-beach?share) is a classic
  hipster brunch -- french toast, omelets, etc. Nothing will be deconstructed,
  though.

## Solana Beach

Standard beach-side town. Easily drive-through but a good place to stop.

- 🍕&🍺[Pizza Port](https://goo.gl/maps/HxM7Pb6ykJCVS7rP9) is a brewery and
  pizzeria. The best (maybe just nostalgic). My go-to here was the Shark Bite
  Red Ale with BBQ Chicken, bacon, and pineapple (don't judge) pizza.
- [Chart House](https://goo.gl/maps/sPAGwVtcoskKxLv38) for the best seafood. It
  is a swanky place, but worth it. They have a sister place across the street,
  but I don't see it anymore.

## Encinitas

This is a classic surf-side town. Tony Hawk is from here!

- 👓[Swamis](https://goo.gl/maps/95hpuTou61oHanRZA) is a surf beach. If you are
  here on a big wave day, you will see some of the best surfers in the world. Go
  early in the morning, grab a cup of coffee, and enjoy.
- ☕️[Lofty Coffee](https://goo.gl/maps/wKXv6DKMjewZFPtj7) grab a coffee here,
  take it to Swamis.
- 🌯[Filberto's](https://goo.gl/maps/qjfzcQMDqy2tDEFcA) for a burrito. It is open
  24/7, may not be the best, but always accessible.

## Del Mar

Just park and walk around.

- 🥪[Board and Brew](https://goo.gl/maps/CPRG135MeifmKCNz9) is a sandwich shop.
  Get the chicken club with the Sweet & Sour dipping sauce. Ask for the sauce
  during purchase, it is not on the menu!
- 🌅[Seagrove Park](https://goo.gl/maps/9DvUJR158xnmUYKKA) watch the sunset here
  one night. Just do it!
- 🌮[Roberto's](https://goo.gl/maps/THKXwrf5fNkySaAa9) is the taco place that
  Blink 182 sang about. Order the fish and shrimp tacos with chips and guac. Sit
  outside and enjoy the cove.

## La Jolla

La Jolla is like Cherry Creek (with Boulder) on the beach. Expensive and
beautiful houses everywhere.

- 🐋[Seal Rock](https://goo.gl/maps/qJ6MK2BTvv9FwWhq9) you can view seals are
  hanging out and sleeping on rocks.
- 🐡[Birch Aquarium](https://goo.gl/maps/aMMKYa7Wv7tY8WA9A) is by far the best
  aquarium I've been to. It is huge!

## Hillcrest 🏳️‍🌈

This is the most excellent neighborhood downtown. Stay here. Coffee shops,
restaurants, etc. This place has grown so much, and I couldn't tell you what's
there anymore.

## Old Town 🇲🇽

Tourist trap of an _authenticate_ Mexican town. I don't recall this being worth
it.
