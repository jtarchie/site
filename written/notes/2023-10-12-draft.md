# Transitioning Back into the Labor Force

I received many responses after sharing my experiences about taking time off
between jobs. Many resonated with my sentiments, while others sought deeper
insights into transitioning back into the workforce. Today, I delve into these
inquiries and illuminate my journey back into the labor force.

Firstly, I want to acknowledge a crucial point: not everyone can take time off.
Financial, familial, and health commitments can often tether us to our roles. I
recognize the privilege I hold as a software engineer, a profession that has
granted me diverse employment opportunities and financial freedom.

A recurring question I've encountered centers around the challenges of reentry.
Specifically, how does one make their return appealing to potential employers
after a significant hiatus?

The bias against career gaps is undeniable. While some perceive it as "time off
from work," I've always viewed it as "time taken for myself." Thankfully, many
of my employers have been understanding and empathetic. Their interview
processes, likely influenced by the nature of software engineering, prioritize
technical expertise over employment gaps.

During my breaks, coding remained a constant passion. My GitHub profile is a
testament to this, bustling with activity as I explore application ideas, some
whimsical and others with potential. Leaving some projects incomplete is
perfectly acceptable; it's all part of the journey.

However, only some interactions have been positive. I distinctly remember a
recruiter who condescendingly, commented on my "little timey offy." While such
biases are disheartening, I've realized that it's impossible to shift every
perspective, especially within the constraints of an interview. Instead, I've
become adept at explaining my breaks, highlighting the flexibility they offer in
interviewing without needing to take PTO.

On the rare occasions when my reasons were probed further, I emphasized my
intent to find the proper role. In more intrusive situations, I've gently
reminded interviewers that some might take breaks for the reasons others can't,
be it health, family, or financial concerns. It's crucial to maintain personal
boundaries. Just as one wouldn't necessarily answer a police officer's question
about perceived wrongdoing, it's best to keep job interviews focused on relevant
topics.

Reentering the workforce has been relatively seamless, though finding the right
reentry point can be time-consuming. When job hunting, I prioritize strong
culture, effective communication, and the ability to prioritize, which can
extend the search.

While my perspective is specific to software engineering, I'm curious if others
in different professions have had similar experiences.

I recognize the inherent privilege inherent in my perspective and advocate for
normalizing career breaks. Everyone has their reasons, and we must respect and
understand them. Whether contemplating a break or rejoining the workforce,
remember that your journey is uniquely yours, and there's no singular correct
path.
