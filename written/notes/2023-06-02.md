# Distillery Apprenticeship

An example of writing something and having ChatGPT rewrite it for two different
tones -- professional and friendly.

## Original (I wrote)

Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is going to be short.

I've been looking for a career change. I'm very interested in the distilling
world and want to be part of it.

I'd like to learn the business -- serving, distilling, numbers, etc. Learning
and contributing to learn the trade. I learn best from people, not from reading.

In a previous life, I was a software engineer, but sitting behind a computer all
day is no longer an option. This industry is where'd I like to go because of the
people. Making something people enjoy, consume, and experiment with.

I'd love to talk and discuss more if there is an apprenticeship-like-thing
available. If this something you'd be interested in let's talk!

Thanks for your time.

Hello [Recipient's Name],

How's it going? I'm JT Archie. I'll keep this short and sweet.

I'm searching for a significant career change, and your distillery has caught my
eye. I've always been intrigued by the distilling world, and I'm excited about
jumping in and getting my hands dirty.

From learning the magic of distilling to understanding the customer service
side, crunching the numbers, and everything in between â€“ I'm eager to know it
all. Not just learning; I'm also keen on contributing to your team while I'm at
it.

In my past life, I was a software engineer. It had its perks, but I've realized
I want more than just staring at a screen all day. I'm drawn to the distilling
industry because of its community vibe and the joy of making something people
can enjoy.

If there's any apprenticeship, or even just an opportunity to learn the ropes,
I'd love to chat more about it. If this sounds interesting to you, let's talk!

Thanks a bunch for taking the time to read my email. I'm looking forward to
being part of the distillery world.

Cheers, JT Archie

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. My name is JT Archie, and I am writing to
express my sincere interest in learning about the distillery business under your
esteemed guidance.

Having developed an intense fascination with the art of distillation, I am keen
to delve deeper into its intricacies â€“ from the technical aspects of distilling
to customer service and the financial side of the business. My objective is to
acquire knowledge and contribute to your esteemed establishment while mastering
the trade.

Before this, I was engaged as a software engineer. While this experience has
honed my problem-solving skills and attention to detail, I yearned for a more
hands-on and people-oriented career. I am attracted to the distilling industry
as it combines craftsmanship, creativity, and community â€“ elements that bring
out the best in me.

Given my preference for experiential learning, an apprenticeship would be an
ideal pathway for me to transition into this field. Should there be any
apprenticeship opportunities or other entry-level positions available at your
distillery, I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to contributing to and
learning from your expert team.

Best regards, JT Archie
