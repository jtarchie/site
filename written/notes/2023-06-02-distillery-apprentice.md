Jumping Into the Distilling World

### Message

Hi! 👋

This message is going to be short.

I'm looking for a career change. I was a software engineer in my previous life,
and I no longer desired to sit behind a desk. I'm very interested in the
distilling world and want to participate.

I want to learn the business – serving, distilling, numbers, etc. I know best
from people with experience, not from reading. Being able to contribute actively
makes. I like this industry because of the people. Making something that they
can enjoy, consume, and experiment with.

If there's any apprenticeship, or even an opportunity to learn the ropes, I'd
love to chat more about it. If this sounds interesting to you, let's talk!

Thanks for your time.
