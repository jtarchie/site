# What happen to the water cooler?

Every generation experiences shifts in office culture. Most notable in recent
years is the transformation brought about by technology, which has significantly
altered how we communicate professionally. It's essential to understand that
these differences are not about one generation being better or worse than the
other; it's about adapting to the changes.

Twenty years ago, the telephone was the primary means of communication in the
office. You'd have a question, and if your colleague were in a different room,
you'd give them a call. If they weren't available, an assistant might answer, or
you'd leave a voicemail. There was a human touch in this interaction. You would
know someone was out because their assistant might say, "They're not available
right now." You'd leave your message, and it would find its way back to the
intended person.

Fast forward to today, how I communicate at work has transformed drastically. We
now have video calls instead of simple phone calls, bringing face-to-face
interaction to our screens. While it's different, it offers another level of
connectivity that wasn't there before. But the avenues of communication continue
beyond there. In addition to checking emails from colleagues, management, or HR,
I also have to navigate a chat program, which is an amalgamation of instant
messaging and email. This chat program lets me sort conversations into groups or
channels tailored to specific audiences, ensuring I stay in the loop on various
topics.

But this new age of accessibility is a double-edged sword. It's not just about
how readily colleagues can reach out to one another; it's also about the sheer
volume and diversity of information at our fingertips. Gone are the days when
knowledge was limited to what one remembered or jotted down in notebooks. Now,
the skill lies in navigating databases, shared drives, and collaborative
platforms to retrieve the needed data. The challenge? Knowing how to locate
information efficiently rather than retaining every detail.

This evolution has undeniably transformed the skill sets required for modern
office roles. Information overload is a genuine concern, a phenomenon we've
become all too familiar with recently. The term "doom scrolling" gained traction
during the pandemic, describing the compulsive consumption of endless news
feeds. But this isn't exclusive to social media or news websites. The same
behavior can manifest in a work environment. With so much data available,
professionals might endlessly sift through reports, emails, or updates, fearing
missing something crucial.

The digital age has introduced numerous notifications throughout my workday.
From updates on the company's codebase to alerts on our 24/7 software that might
ping me in the early morning hours if there's an issue. There's always something
seeking my attention.

In a sense, today's technology has made us more accessible than ever. While our
work might have ended decades ago once we left the office, the devices in our
pockets now ensure we're always within reach. This constant accessibility can be
a double-edged sword. It's great for immediate collaboration but can also be
demanding.

Many argue that returning to the office is essential for better communication.
While face-to-face interaction is invaluable, it's necessary to recognize that
the methods of communication have evolved. The water cooler conversations of
yesteryears are now replaced by instant messages and video chats. The
traditional water cooler itself might be a thing of the past.

In conclusion, the landscape of office communication has undoubtedly shifted
with technology's rise. Both eras have their merits. It's not about longing for
the past or fearing the future but understanding and adapting to our present. I
value my peace and don't wish to be accessible around the clock, but I also
appreciate the advancements that allow for more versatile and instant
communication. The key is finding a balance for each individual in this
ever-changing environment.
