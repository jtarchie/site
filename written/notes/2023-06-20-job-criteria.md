# Job Requirements

Outlined below are essential considerations for my prospective job role. They
are prioritized: must-haves, negotiable, and bonus features.

- I value a flexible, four-day workweek prioritizing measurable goals over
  quantifiable output.
- An opportunity to shape and evolve the workplace culture is essential. I am
  eager to overcome the barriers of "status quo" thinking and drive change that
  enhances organizational efficiency and work-life quality.
- Effective and streamlined communication is a crucial requirement. The central
  tenet is that 'information should be readily available and easily accessible.'
  - Implementation of a well-structured information architecture is vital,
    supplementing keyword searches with a system that assigns priority to
    documents.
  - The preferred sequence for information retrieval should be Company Wiki >
    Slack/Email > Direct Personal Inquiry, conditional on the above requirement.
  - Maintenance of up-to-date documentation is essential:
    - All links should be functional, ensuring no dead ends or error pages.
    - If the author of any document is no longer part of the organization, the
      team must provide an alternate contact must be provided.
  - Transparency in team structures, roles, and projects is necessary. Clear
    information about team memberships, individual responsibilities, and
    collaborative interactions should be readily available.
