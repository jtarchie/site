# Job Requirements

Outlined below are essential considerations for my prospective job role. They
are prioritized: must-haves, negotiable, and bonus features.

- A flexible, four-day workweek prioritizing measurable goals over quantifiable
  output.
- An opportunity to shape and evolve the workplace culture is essential. Eager
  to overcome the barriers of "status quo" thinking and drive change that
  enhances organizational efficiency and work-life quality.
- Accessibility and openness of communication with team members and colleagues
  across the organization. Expecting the opportunity to engage in one-on-one
  meetings, ensuring that scheduling such meetings will typically take place
  within a week's notice.
- Encompassing engineering within the product development cycle involves active
  customer engagement to develop effective, user-friendly solutions. The three
  core disciplines of design, product management, and engineering must
  collaborate seamlessly throughout the process.
- Effective and streamlined communication is a crucial requirement. The central
  tenet is that 'information should be readily available and easily accessible.'
  - Implementation of a well-structured information architecture is vital,
    supplementing keyword searches with a system that assigns priority to
    documents.
  - The preferred sequence for information retrieval should be Company Wiki >
    Slack/Email > Direct Personal Inquiry, conditional on the above requirement.
  - Maintenance of up-to-date documentation is essential:
    - All links should be functional, ensuring no dead ends or error pages.
    - Each page should have a link to it, via table contents, follow through
      from another page, etc. to allow for discovery and importance.
    - If the author of any document is no longer part of the organization, the
      team must update the contact on that document. If they cannot, it must be
      identified as abandon literature.
    - If a page reaches a certain date of infrequency of not having been
      updated, having no visitors, etc. then it should be marked as a _stale_
      automatically.
  - Transparency in team structures, roles, and projects is necessary. Clear
    information about team memberships, individual responsibilities, and
    collaborative interactions should be readily available.
