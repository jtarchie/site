# Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Managers:

<!-- intro -->

I bring over 15+ years of experience as a software engineer to the table,
including work as a consultant, which has given me exposure to various business
domains. My experience with enterprise customers has taught me the importance of
having a process in place to streamline and align teams towards sustainable
deliverables.

Mid-way through my career, I made a deliberate shift from full-stack web
programming to backend distributed cloud systems. I have applied the same
product development methodologies across different business domains, which has
allowed me to feel comfortable rotating between different technology stacks.

I am proud of my ability to rescue products, mentor new engineers, and create
balanced teams. I have a proven track record of delivering software in a
corporate environment, and I am passionate about CI/CD, as my personal motto is,
"Automate yourself out of a job."

I am eager for my next challenge and enjoy building products that people find
useful. I believe my experience and toolset will add value to any team, and I am
looking forward to working with like-minded individuals.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to
discuss my qualifications in further detail.

Kind Regards,

JT Archie
