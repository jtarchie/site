# TypeScript: Type Guards for Safer Code

TypeScript type guards are a powerful feature that allows you to ensure type
safety within your code. They help you avoid runtime errors by checking the
types of your variables before performing any operations. This guide
demonstrates how to use type guards to make your TypeScript code more reliable
and maintainable.

Consider a simple example where you have a union type `Person` that can be
either a `Student` or a `Teacher`:

```typescript
interface Student {
  role: "student";
  grade: number;
}

interface Teacher {
  role: "teacher";
  subject: string;
}

type Person = Student | Teacher;
```

You want to create a function that takes a `Person` as an argument and logs
their information. Without type guards, you may face issues with accessing
properties that don't exist on one of the types:

```typescript
function logPersonInfo(person: Person) {
  console.log(`Role: ${person.role}`);
  // These lines will cause a TypeScript error because the properties might not exist on the type
  console.log(`Grade: ${person.grade}`);
  console.log(`Subject: ${person.subject}`);
}
```

With type guards, you can ensure type safety by checking the type of the
`person` before accessing the properties: By using type guards, you can ensure
that your TypeScript code is type-safe, reducing the likelihood of runtime
errors and improving code reliability and maintainability.

```typescript
function logPersonInfo(person: Person) {
  console.log(`Role: ${person.role}`);

  if (person.role === "student") {
    console.log(`Grade: ${person.grade}`);
  } else if (person.role === "teacher") {
    console.log(`Subject: ${person.subject}`);
  }
}

const student: Student = { role: "student", grade: 8 };
const teacher: Teacher = { role: "teacher", subject: "Math" };

logPersonInfo(student); // Output: Role: student, Grade: 8
logPersonInfo(teacher); // Output: Role: teacher, Subject: Math
```
