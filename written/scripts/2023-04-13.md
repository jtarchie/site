# Ruby Syntax Sugar

Ruby has syntax sugar that can help write more readable code, once you
understand it.

For example, given a list of words, let have them all lowercase.

```ruby
words = ['Tea Cup', 'AmAzIng'].map do |word|
  word.downcase
end
```

We can use syntax sugar to avoid the boiler plate.

The ampersand says, call the `downcase` method on each value.

```ruby
words = ['Tea Cup', 'AmAzIng'].map(&:downcase)
```
