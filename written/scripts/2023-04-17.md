# Go Slices: Efficiently Append Elements

In Go, slices are a powerful and flexible data structure for handling sequences
of values. One common operation is appending elements to a slice. This guide
demonstrates how to efficiently append elements to a slice while minimizing
memory reallocations.

Consider a simple example where you want to create a slice of integers and
append values to it:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    nums := []int{}
    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        nums = append(nums, i)
    }

    fmt.Println(nums)
}
```

In this example, each call to `append` might cause a memory reallocation, which
can be expensive in terms of performance. To optimize this, you can use the
`make` function to preallocate the underlying array:

By using `make` with a capacity argument (`cap`), you allocate enough memory for
the underlying array at the beginning, avoiding costly reallocations during the
append operation. This can lead to better performance and more efficient memory
usage in your Go programs.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    nums := make([]int, 0, 10)
    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        nums = append(nums, i)
    }

    fmt.Println(nums)
}
```
