# JavaScript Array Tricks: Using map() and filter()

JavaScript provides some powerful methods to manipulate arrays, such as `map()`
and `filter()`. These methods can help you write cleaner, more efficient code.

## Using map()

The `map()` method allows you to create a new array by applying a function to
each element of an existing array. Here's an example:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const squared = numbers.map((num) => num * num);

console.log(squared); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

## Using filter()

The `filter()` method is used to create a new array with only the elements that
pass a certain condition. Here's an example:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter((num) => num % 2 === 0);

console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4]
```

In this example, we create a new array of even numbers by filtering the original
array using the given condition.

By utilizing `map()` and `filter()`, you can write more concise and readable
code when working with arrays in JavaScript.
