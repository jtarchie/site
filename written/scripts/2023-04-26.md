# JavaScript: Using Arrow Functions for Cleaner Syntax

Arrow functions in JavaScript provide a more concise syntax for writing function
expressions, making your code easier to read and maintain.

Consider an example where you want to create a function that takes two numbers
and returns their sum. Using the traditional function expression:

```javascript
// Traditional function expression
const add = function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
```

With arrow functions, you can simplify the syntax and make the function more
readable:

```javascript
// Arrow function
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

Arrow functions not only shorten the syntax but also have other benefits, such
as automatic binding of the `this` keyword to the surrounding scope. Here's an
example of using an arrow function with the `map()` method. As you can see,
arrow functions make your code more concise and easier to read.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Traditional function expression
const squares1 = numbers.map(function (number) {
  return number * number;
});

// Arrow function
const squares2 = numbers.map((number) => number * number);
```
