# JavaScript Destructuring: Simplify Object Access

JavaScript destructuring is a powerful feature that allows you to easily access
properties from objects or elements from arrays. This guide demonstrates how
destructuring can be used to simplify your code and improve readability.

Consider an object representing a user with `firstName`, `lastName`, and `email`
properties:

```javascript
const user = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  email: "john.doe@example.com",
};
```

Without destructuring, you would access each property like this:

```javascript
const firstName = user.firstName;
const lastName = user.lastName;
const email = user.email;

console.log(firstName, lastName, email);
```

With destructuring, you can simplify the above code as follows:

By using destructuring, you can extract multiple properties from an object in a
single line, reducing the need for repetitive code and improving readability.

```javascript
const { firstName, lastName, email } = user;

console.log(firstName, lastName, email);
```
