# Ruby on Rails: Simplify Routing with Nested Resources

Nested resources in Rails routing can help you create clean, organized, and
maintainable routes by reflecting the relationships between your models.

Consider an example with a `Post` model and a `Comment` model, where a `Post`
has many `Comment`s. Instead of defining separate routes for posts and comments:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :posts
  resources :comments
end
```

You can use nested resources to create hierarchical URLs. Now, the URLs will
reflect the relationship between posts and comments.

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :posts do
    resources :comments
  end
end
```

Nested resources improve your application's structure and maintainability by
creating clean and organized routes.

```bash
/posts/:post_id/comments
/posts/:post_id/comments/:id
```
