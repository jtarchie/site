# Lua Tables: Quick and Easy Key-Value Pairs

Lua tables are versatile data structures that can be used for various purposes,
including arrays, dictionaries, and more. This guide focuses on using Lua tables
as key-value pairs, providing an efficient way to store and access data.

Consider a simple example where you want to store information about a user. This
is a standard key-value pair.

```lua
local user = {
  name = "John Doe",
  age = 30,
  email = "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

You can access the data stored in the table using the key associated with each
value. This id done using the dot lookup.

```lua
print(user.name)  -- Output: John Doe
print(user.age)   -- Output: 30
print(user.email) -- Output: john.doe@example.com
```

You can also add new key-value pairs to the table or update existing ones.

By using Lua tables as key-value pairs, you can easily store, access, and modify
data in a structured and readable way. This can lead to better code organization
and improved code readability in your Lua projects.

```lua
user.phone = "555-1234"          -- Add a new key-value pair
user.email = "john@example.com"  -- Update the existing value

print(user.phone) -- Output: 555-1234
print(user.email) -- Output: john@example.com
```
