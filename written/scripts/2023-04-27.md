# Ruby on Rails: Improve App Performance with Counter Caches

Counter caches can significantly improve your Ruby on Rails application's
performance by helping you avoid expensive database queries when counting
associated records. This guide demonstrates how to use counter caches to
optimize your Rails app.

Consider a scenario where you have a `Post` model and a `Comment` model, and you
want to display the number of comments for each post. Without counter caches,
you might use the following code to count the comments for a post, which
triggers a database query every time you need to count the comments, impacting
your app's performance:

```ruby
post.comments.count
```

To implement a counter cache, first, add a new column to the parent model
(`posts` in this example) with a `_count` suffix. This command creates a
migration to add the `comments_count` column to the `posts` table:

```bash
rails generate migration AddCommentsCountToPosts comments_count:integer
```

Next, set the default value for the new column to 0 and make it non-nullable in
the migration file:

```ruby
# db/migrate/YYYYMMDD_add_comments_count_to_posts.rb
class AddCommentsCountToPosts < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
  def change
    add_column :posts, :comments_count, :integer, default: 0, null: false
  end
end
```

Run the migration to apply the changes to the database:

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

Now, update the `belongs_to` association in the child model to include the
`counter_cache` option, which will automatically update the `comments_count`
column in the `posts` table whenever a comment is added or removed:

```ruby
# app/models/comment.rb
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :post, counter_cache: true
end
```

Finally, update the existing records in the database to reflect the correct
count. You can execute this code in the Rails console or create a one-time rake
task:

```ruby
Post.find_each { |post| Post.reset_counters(post.id, :comments) }
```

With the counter cache in place, you can now use the counter cache column to
display the number of comments for a post, eliminating the need for additional
database queries and improving your app's performance:

```ruby
post.comments_count
```

By using counter caches in your Ruby on Rails application, you can optimize
performance and enhance user experience by avoiding expensive database queries
when counting associated records.
