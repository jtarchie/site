# Comparing Python and JavaScript: List Comprehension vs Array.map()

Both Python and JavaScript offer ways to transform lists or arrays with concise
and readable syntax. In this example, we'll compare Python's list comprehensions
with JavaScript's Array.map() method.

**Goal:** Create a list or array of the squares of numbers from 0 to 4.

## Python: List Comprehension

In Python, you can use list comprehensions to create a new list by applying an
operation to each element in an existing list or range:

```python
squares = [i * i for i in range(5)]
print(squares)
# Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
```

## JavaScript: Array.map()

In JavaScript, you can use the `Array.map()` method to create a new array by
applying a function to each element in an existing array:

```javascript
const numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4];
const squares = numbers.map((i) => i * i);
console.log(squares);
// Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
```

Both approaches help you create more readable and efficient code when
transforming lists or arrays.
