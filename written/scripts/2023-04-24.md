# Ruby on Rails: Optimize ActiveRecord Queries with Eager Loading

In Ruby on Rails, ActiveRecord is a powerful and flexible Object-Relational
Mapping (ORM) library for working with databases. One common performance issue
when working with ActiveRecord is the N+1 query problem.

The N+1 query problem occurs when you retrieve a list of records and their
associated records, resulting in one query for the initial list and an
additional query for each associated record. This can lead to a significant
performance issue in your Rails application.

For example, let's assume you have a `Post` model and a `Comment` model, with a
`Post` having many `Comment`s:

```ruby
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :comments
end

class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :post
end
```

To display a list of posts and their comments without eager loading, you might
do the following. In this example, you'll have one query for fetching the posts
and then an additional query for each post's comments, resulting in the N+1
query problem.

```ruby
@posts = Post.all

@posts.each do |post|
  puts "Post: #{post.title}"
  post.comments.each do |comment|
    puts "  Comment: #{comment.body}"
  end
end
```

To solve this issue, you can use eager loading with the `includes` method. By
using `includes`, ActiveRecord will now fetch all the required data in two
queries instead of N+1 queries, significantly improving the performance of your
Rails application.

```ruby
@posts = Post.includes(:comments)

@posts.each do |post|
  puts "Post: #{post.title}"
  post.comments.each do |comment|
    puts "  Comment: #{comment.body}"
  end
end
```

Eager loading with ActiveRecord is a powerful technique that can help you
optimize your Rails application, avoid the N+1 query problem, and improve
overall performance.
