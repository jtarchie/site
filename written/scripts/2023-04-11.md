# Ruby Syntax Sugar: Implicit Return

Ruby syntax sugar allows you to write more concise and readable code. One such
example is the implicit return feature in Ruby.

Let's say you have a method that calculates the square of a number:

```ruby
def square(num)
  return num * num
end

result = square(4)
puts result #=> 16
```

In Ruby, you can take advantage of the implicit return feature to remove the
`return` keyword, making your code more concise:

In this example, the return value of the method is automatically the result of
the last expression evaluated, which is `num * num`. This is a useful feature
when writing methods with a single expression, as it makes the code more
readable and succinct.

```ruby
def square(num)
  num * num
end

result = square(4)
puts result #=> 16
```
