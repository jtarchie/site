### How to Run for Office as a Democrat in Colorado (Local, State, & Federal Levels)

Running for public office in Colorado involves meeting legal qualifications,
navigating ballot access (via party assembly or petition), adhering to campaign
finance rules, and engaging with the Democratic Party’s nomination process.
Below is a comprehensive guide covering eligibility, filing procedures and
deadlines, signature requirements, campaign finance obligations, party-specific
processes, and key resources. All information is up-to-date for the upcoming
election cycle, with official sources cited.

### Eligibility Requirements by Office

**Federal Offices (U.S. House & U.S. Senate):** To run for U.S. Representative,
you must be at least 25 years old, a U.S. citizen for at least 7 years, and an
inhabitant of Colorado (though you need not reside in the specific congressional
district)
([Candidate Qualifications](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/qualifications.html#:~:text=Office%20US%20Representative)).
U.S. Senate candidates must be at least 30, a U.S. citizen for 9 years, and a
resident of Colorado
([Candidate Qualifications](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/qualifications.html#:~:text=Office%20US%20Senator)).
There is no specific term limit for Congress (though Colorado allows candidates
to _voluntarily_ pledge term limits)
([Candidate Qualifications](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/qualifications.html#:~:text=Length%20of%20term%202%20years))
([Candidate Qualifications](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/qualifications.html#:~:text=US%20citizen%209%20years%20)).

**Statewide Offices (Governor, etc.):** Colorado’s Governor and Lt. Governor
must be at least 30 years old, U.S. citizens, and Colorado residents for at
least 2 years before election
([Candidate Qualifications](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/qualifications.html#:~:text=Office%20Governor)).
Other statewide executive offices (Attorney General, Secretary of State,
Treasurer) generally require a minimum age of 25, U.S. citizenship, and 2 years
of state residency
([Candidate Qualifications](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/qualifications.html#:~:text=Office%20Attorney%20General%C2%A0%20))
([Candidate Qualifications](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/qualifications.html#:~:text=Office%20Secretary%20of%20State)).
All these offices have 4-year terms and are term-limited to two consecutive
terms
([Candidate Qualifications](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/qualifications.html#:~:text=Length%20of%20term%204%20years,8)).
The Attorney General and District Attorneys must also be licensed attorneys in
Colorado (with D.A.s requiring 5 years of Colorado law practice)
([Candidate Qualifications](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/qualifications.html#:~:text=,VI%2C%20Sections%2011%20%26%2013)).

**State Legislature (Colorado General Assembly):** To run for the Colorado House
of Representatives or State Senate, you must be at least 25 years old, a U.S.
citizen, and have resided in Colorado for at least 1 year. You also must have
lived in the legislative district for 12 months prior to the election
([Candidate Qualifications](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/qualifications.html#:~:text=Office%20State%20Representative))
([Candidate Qualifications](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/qualifications.html#:~:text=Office%20State%20Senator)).
State House members serve 2-year terms (limited to 4 terms) and State Senators
serve 4-year terms (limited to 2 terms)
([Candidate Qualifications](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/qualifications.html#:~:text=US%20citizen%20Yes))
([Candidate Qualifications](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/qualifications.html#:~:text=US%20citizen%20Yes)).

**County & Local Offices:** Qualifications for county offices (e.g. County
Commissioner, Sheriff, Clerk) and municipal offices (e.g. Mayor, City Council)
vary. Generally, you must be an eligible elector of the jurisdiction — meaning
at least 18 years old, a U.S. citizen, and a resident of the county/city for a
set period (often 12+ months)
([Candidate Qualifications](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/qualifications.html#:~:text=County%20%26%20Municipal)).
Because requirements can differ by locality and office, you should verify
specifics with the county clerk or municipal clerk where you intend to run
([County Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/county.html#:~:text=Contact%20your%20county%20clerk%E2%80%99s%20office,running%20for%20a%20county%20office))
([Candidate FAQs](https://www.coloradosos.gov/pubs/elections/FAQs/Candidate.html#:~:text=Candidates%20for%20municipal%20office%20should,they%20are%20running%20for%20office)).
(For example, some city charters require candidates to be registered voters in
the city for a certain time before the election.)

### Filing Process and Deadlines

Colorado does not have a single universal “filing day” for candidates; instead,
the process and deadlines depend on how you access the ballot
([Candidate FAQs](https://www.coloradosos.gov/pubs/elections/FAQs/Candidate.html#:~:text=Q3,for%20candidacy)).
As a Democratic candidate, you have two main paths to get on the primary ballot:
**party assembly nomination or petition** (you may also run as a write-in or,
for nonpartisan local races, via a municipal process). Below is an overview of
the steps:

- **1. Affiliate with the Democratic Party:** To run as a Democrat, you _must_
  be registered as a Democrat no later than the first business day of January of
  the election year
  ([Major Party Candidate Petition](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyPetition.html#:~:text=Candidates%20must%20meet%20the%20basic,qualifications%20for%20office))
  ([Major Party Assembly Designation](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyAssembly.html#:~:text=Candidates%20must%20meet%20the%20basic,qualifications%20for%20office)).
  (For example, for the 2024 elections, you needed to be a registered Democrat
  by January 2, 2024.) This is a state law requirement for major-party
  candidates. Always double-check with party rules as well, but the Colorado
  Democratic Party follows this general deadline
  ([Major Party Assembly Designation](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyAssembly.html#:~:text=Candidates%20must%20meet%20the%20basic,qualifications%20for%20office)).

- **2. “Become a Candidate” – Initial Filings:** Once you decide to run and
  before actively campaigning, you should complete initial filings:
  - **Public Announcement & Committee Registration:** Publicly announce your
    intent and, if you plan to raise/spend money, register a candidate committee
    with the Colorado Secretary of State (via the TRACER system). You may remain
    a “standalone” candidate if you will only spend your own funds and not take
    contributions
    ([State Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/state.html#:~:text=Step%204%3A%20Register%20a%20candidate,are%20you%20a%20standalone%20candidate))
    ([State Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/state.html#:~:text=If%20you%20intend%20to%20accept,must%20register%20a%20candidate%20committee)).
    A candidate committee must be registered _before_ receiving any
    contributions
    ([State Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/state.html#:~:text=Step%204%3A%20Register%20a%20candidate,are%20you%20a%20standalone%20candidate))
    ([County Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/county.html#:~:text=A%20candidate%20committee%20is%20required,are%20therefore%20a%20standalone%20candidate)).
  - **Candidate Affidavit:** Within 10 days of becoming a candidate (i.e.
    announcing and either receiving a contribution or spending money), file a
    Candidate Affidavit electronically with the Secretary of State
    ([State Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/state.html#:~:text=Step%206%3A%20File%20a%20candidate,voluntary%20spending%20acceptance%2C%20if%20applicable)).
    This affidavit affirms you’re familiar with campaign finance laws
    ([State Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/state.html#:~:text=1,Campaign%20Finance%20Rule%202.3)).
    If you choose to accept Colorado’s voluntary spending limits, you can
    indicate this on the affidavit (at the time of filing)
    ([State Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/state.html#:~:text=2,XXVIII%20of%20the%20Colorado%20Constitution)).
  - **Personal Financial Disclosure:** State-level candidates (for legislature
    or statewide office) must file a Personal Financial Disclosure Statement
    within 10 days of the affidavit
    ([State Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/state.html#:~:text=Step%207%3A%20File%20a%20personal,financial%20disclosure)).
    This is submitted to the Colorado Secretary of State’s Campaign Finance
    office (via mail, hand delivery, or email)
    ([State Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/state.html#:~:text=Within%2010%20days%20of%20submitting,your%20candidate%20affidavit)).
    **Note:** County and municipal candidates are _not_ required to file the
    state personal financial disclosure
    ([County Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/county.html#:~:text=Become%20a%20candidate)),
    though some local jurisdictions may have their own disclosure requirements.

- **3. Choose a Ballot Access Method:** Next, decide whether to seek the
  Democratic nomination via the **party assembly** or by **petition** (or both).
  Major party candidates in Colorado can _either_ be designated at party
  assembly _or_ collect petition signatures to get on the primary ballot
  ([How do you intend to access the ballot?](https://www.coloradosos.gov/pubs/elections/Candidates/USRepAndSenateMethods.html#:~:text=1.%20Assembly%20Nomination%20,69)).
  Below are the processes and key deadlines for each:

  **A) Party Assembly Nomination (Democratic Party Convention process):**\
  The Democratic Party holds caucuses and assemblies in the spring of the
  election year to designate candidates:
  - **Precinct Caucus:** In early March (e.g. March 9, 2024), Democratic voters
    meet in their precincts to elect delegates to county assemblies
    ([2024 Election Calendar](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/calendars/2024ElectionCalendar.pdf#:~:text=Secretary%20of%20State%20Presidential%20Primary,clerk%20and%20recorder%20of%20each))
    ([Caucuses, Assemblies and Conventions FAQs](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/FAQs/caucuses.html#:~:text=Q1,caucus)).
    Participation requires being a registered Democrat in that precinct for at
    least 22 days prior
    ([Caucuses, Assemblies and Conventions FAQs](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/FAQs/caucuses.html#:~:text=A2,caucus%20a%20voter%20must%20be)).
    _Tip:_ If you’re running, encourage supporters to attend caucus and become
    delegates for you.
  - **County and/or District Assemblies:** Delegates from caucus convene in
    county or multi-county assemblies (typically in late March or early April)
    to vote on candidates. To seek assembly nomination, you **must notify the
    party in writing at least 30 days before the assembly** of your intent to be
    considered
    ([Major Party Assembly Designation](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyAssembly.html#:~:text=party%20protocol%2C%20announcements%2C%20party%20campaign,rules%2C%20etc))
    ([Major Party Assembly Designation](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyAssembly.html#:~:text=,notice%20to%20the%20state%20chair)).
    (Notify the county chair for a county-level race, the multi-county or state
    party chair as applicable for legislative or statewide races
    ([Major Party Assembly Designation](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyAssembly.html#:~:text=To%20be%20named%20as%20a,4)).)
  - **Assembly Vote and Threshold:** At the assembly, delegates vote on
    candidates for each office. A Democratic candidate must receive at least
    **30% of delegate votes** for that office to be placed on the primary ballot
    ([Major Party Assembly Designation](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyAssembly.html#:~:text=Candidates%20who%20wish%20to%20gain,2))
    ([Major Party Assembly Designation](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyAssembly.html#:~:text=Major%20political%20party%20candidates%20may,5)).
    (If no one reaches 30%, the top two candidates go on the ballot after a
    second round
    ([Major Party Assembly Designation](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyAssembly.html#:~:text=A%20candidate%20needs%20at%20least,6)).)
    This 30% rule is crucial – failing to get 30% means you will not be the
    party’s designated candidate for the primary. (Also, if you get less than
    10% at assembly, you are barred from petitioning onto the ballot for the
    same race
    ([Major Party Candidate Petition](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyPetition.html#:~:text=A%20candidate%20must%20be%20affiliated,1))
    ([Major Party Candidate Petition](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyPetition.html#:~:text=A%20candidate%20that%20failed%20to,2)).)
  - **Certification:** After the assembly, the party will file a **certificate
    of designation** with the Secretary of State, listing the candidates
    nominated by assembly
    ([Major Party Assembly Designation](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyAssembly.html#:~:text=Step%204%3A%20Submit%20certificate%20of,designation%20form))
    ([Major Party Assembly Designation](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyAssembly.html#:~:text=Email%3A%20ballot.access%40coloradosos.gov%20Fax%3A%20303)).
    This must be submitted within 4 days of the assembly’s adjournment.
    Candidates must also submit a signed **candidate acceptance of assembly
    designation** form, affirming they accept the nomination
    ([Major Party Assembly Designation](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyAssembly.html#:~:text=Step%205%3A%20Submit%20candidate%20acceptance,form)).
  - **Timeline:** By law, party assemblies for primary races must conclude no
    later than **73 days before the primary election**
    ([Major Party Assembly Designation](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyAssembly.html#:~:text=Major%20political%20party%20candidates%20may,5)).
    Colorado’s primary is in late June (June 25, 2024), so assemblies are
    generally held by early April. For example, in 2024 most Democratic county
    assemblies and the state assembly occurred by mid-April. Be sure to check
    with the Colorado Democratic Party for exact caucus and assembly dates each
    cycle.

  **B) Petition onto the Primary Ballot:**\
  Candidates may bypass the assembly or supplement it by collecting signatures
  from voters:
  - **Petition Eligibility:** You must still meet the basic office
    qualifications and be a registered Democrat by the Jan 1 deadline to use the
    petition method
    ([Major Party Candidate Petition](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyPetition.html#:~:text=Candidates%20must%20meet%20the%20basic,qualifications%20for%20office)).
    Also, **if you participated in the assembly and got under 10% of the vote,
    you cannot later petition for that same race**
    ([Major Party Candidate Petition](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyPetition.html#:~:text=A%20candidate%20must%20be%20affiliated,1)).
    So, candidates often choose one route or the other (or begin petitioning as
    a backup but withdraw if they secure assembly nomination).
  - **Circulating Petitions:** Major-party petitions can be circulated starting
    the **third Tuesday in January** of the election year (e.g. January
    16, 2024)
    ([2024 Election Calendar](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/calendars/2024ElectionCalendar.pdf#:~:text=second%20Friday%20in%20January%29%201,March%205th%20Presidential%20Primary%20Election)).
    Only U.S. citizens age 18+ can circulate petitions
    ([Major Party Candidate Petition](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyPetition.html#:~:text=statewide%20voter%20registration%20system.%20)).
    Petition signers must be **registered Democratic voters in the district**
    (or unaffiliated voters cannot sign for a party candidate)
    ([Major Party Candidate Petition](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyPetition.html#:~:text=Only%20eligible%20electors%20registered%20as,5)).
    Each signer must have been affiliated as a Democrat for at least 22 days at
    the time of signing and reside in the district for the office
    ([Major Party Candidate Petition](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyPetition.html#:~:text=Only%20eligible%20electors%20registered%20as,5)).
  - **Signature Requirements:** The number of valid signatures needed varies by
    office:
    - _Statewide offices_ (Governor, Secretary of State, etc.): **1,500
      signatures per congressional district**
      ([Petition Signature Requirements](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/SignatureRequirements.html#:~:text=CU%20Regent%2C%20District%201%2C500%20or,whichever%20is%20less))
      ([Petition Signature Requirements](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/SignatureRequirements.html#:~:text=State%20Treasurer%201%2C000%20per%20congressional,If%20there%20was)).
      Colorado has 8 U.S. House districts, so this typically means 12,000 total
      signatures spread across the state (1,500 from each district).
    - _U.S. House of Representatives:_ **1,500 signatures or 10% of the votes
      cast in the last Democratic primary for that seat, whichever is fewer**
      ([Petition Signature Requirements](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/SignatureRequirements.html#:~:text=State%20Representative%201%2C000%20or%2030,general%20election%20for%20that%20office)).
      (In practice, 1,500 is usually the requirement, unless the prior primary
      had very low turnout.)
    - _State Senate and State House:_ **1,000 signatures or 30% of the last
      primary vote for that district, whichever is fewer**
      ([Petition Signature Requirements](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/SignatureRequirements.html#:~:text=State%20Board%20of%20Education%2C%20District,If%20there%20was)).
    - _County Offices:_ **1,000 signatures or 10% of the last primary vote in
      that county race, whichever is fewer**
      ([Petition Signature Requirements](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/SignatureRequirements.html#:~:text=Office%20Signatures%20required%20Attorney%20General,Large%20500%20per%20congressional%20district)).
    - _(These figures are for major-party primary petitions as set by state law
      ([Petition Signature Requirements](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/SignatureRequirements.html#:~:text=Office%20Signatures%20required%20Attorney%20General,Large%20500%20per%20congressional%20district))
      ([Petition Signature Requirements](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/SignatureRequirements.html#:~:text=State%20Board%20of%20Education%2C%20District,If%20there%20was)).
      Always verify the latest numbers with the Secretary of State, as they can
      adjust based on prior election turnout.)_
  - **Petition Deadline:** Completed petitions must be turned in no later than
    the **third Tuesday in March** of the election year
    ([2024 Election Calendar](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/calendars/2024ElectionCalendar.pdf#:~:text=,March%20%28Tuesday)).
    For example, the final filing day for 2024 primary petitions was March 26,
    2024
    ([2024 Election Calendar](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/calendars/2024ElectionCalendar.pdf#:~:text=,March%20%28Tuesday)).
    It’s wise to submit early if possible, to allow time for signature
    verification and any cure of insufficiencies.
  - **Verification:** After submission, the Secretary of State’s office will
    verify signatures. If you meet the requirement with sufficient valid
    signatures, you’ll be notified that your petition was sufficient and your
    name will be placed on the Democratic primary ballot
    ([Major Party Candidate Petition](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyPetition.html#:~:text=5,Name%20placed%20on%20ballot))
    ([Major Party Candidate Petition](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyPetition.html#:~:text=7,Name%20placed%20on%20ballot)).

- **4. Primary Election:** If more than one Democrat qualifies for the primary
  ballot (via assembly or petition), a primary election will be held in late
  June. Colorado’s primaries are **semi-open** – unaffiliated voters may
  participate by choosing a Democratic primary ballot (they do not have to
  register with the party) in addition to registered Democrats
  ([Major Party Candidate Petition](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyPetition.html#:~:text=Only%20eligible%20electors%20registered%20as,5)).
  The candidate who wins the Democratic primary (by plurality) becomes the
  party’s nominee for the November general election.

- **5. Running in General Election (if no primary or as a write-in):** If you
  are your party’s sole candidate, you may be unopposed in the primary and
  advance directly. If you missed getting on the primary ballot, running as a
  **write-in** for the general election is another route – but you must file an
  affidavit of intent to run as a write-in by mid-July for the general election
  ([2024 Election Calendar](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/calendars/2024ElectionCalendar.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L1078%20,July%20%28Tuesday)).
  Note that Colorado’s “sore loser” law prevents someone who lost a primary from
  running as a write-in or independent in the general election for the same
  office.

**Local (Municipal) Elections:** Many city elections in Colorado are nonpartisan
and may occur in odd years or different timelines. To run for a city office
(e.g., city council or mayor), you usually file nomination petitions with the
city clerk rather than going through a party primary
([Candidate FAQs](https://www.coloradosos.gov/pubs/elections/FAQs/Candidate.html#:~:text=A2,documents%20relating%20to%20your%20candidacy)).
The signature and filing deadlines for municipal races are set by city ordinance
or charter (for instance, a city may require a certain number of signatures from
city voters and have a filing deadline a few months before the municipal
election). Always check with the municipal clerk for those local rules
([Candidate FAQs](https://www.coloradosos.gov/pubs/elections/FAQs/Candidate.html#:~:text=Candidates%20for%20municipal%20office%20should,they%20are%20running%20for%20office)).
If the municipal race _is_ partisan or if you seek a county office, you will
likely follow the same general timeline as above (county party assembly or
petition by spring, then the November general election).

### Signature Collection Requirements

As outlined above, signature requirements apply **only if you choose to petition
onto the ballot** (assembly-nominated candidates do not need to collect
signatures). Here’s a summary for quick reference:

- **U.S. Senate / Governor (Statewide):** 1,500 signatures per congressional
  district
  ([Petition Signature Requirements](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/SignatureRequirements.html#:~:text=CU%20Regent%2C%20District%201%2C500%20or,whichever%20is%20less))
  ([Petition Signature Requirements](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/SignatureRequirements.html#:~:text=State%20Treasurer%201%2C000%20per%20congressional,If%20there%20was)).
  (With 8 districts, total ~12,000 signatures statewide.)
- **U.S. House:** 1,500 or 10% of last Dem primary vote in that district
  (whichever is less)
  ([Petition Signature Requirements](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/SignatureRequirements.html#:~:text=State%20Representative%201%2C000%20or%2030,general%20election%20for%20that%20office)).
- **State Senate / State Representative:** 1,000 or 30% of last Dem primary vote
  (whichever is less) in that district
  ([Petition Signature Requirements](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/SignatureRequirements.html#:~:text=State%20Board%20of%20Education%2C%20District,If%20there%20was)).
- **Other Statewide (Secretary of State, etc.):** 1,000 per congressional
  district (total ~8,000) for offices like Secretary of State or State Treasurer
  ([Petition Signature Requirements](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/SignatureRequirements.html#:~:text=Attorney%20General%201%2C000%20per%20congressional,whichever%20is))
  ([Petition Signature Requirements](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/SignatureRequirements.html#:~:text=State%20Treasurer%201%2C000%20per%20congressional,If%20there%20was));
  1,000 per CD for Attorney General as well
  ([Petition Signature Requirements](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/SignatureRequirements.html#:~:text=Office%20Signatures%20required%20Attorney%20General,Large%20500%20per%20congressional%20district)).
- **County Offices:** 1,000 or 10% of last primary vote in that county race
  (whichever is less)
  ([Petition Signature Requirements](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/SignatureRequirements.html#:~:text=Office%20Signatures%20required%20Attorney%20General,Large%20500%20per%20congressional%20district)).
- **District Attorney (Judicial District):** 1,000 or 10% of last primary vote
  (whichever is less) in that judicial district
  ([Petition Signature Requirements](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/SignatureRequirements.html#:~:text=County%20Offices%201%2C000%20or%2010,whichever%20is%20less)).
- **University of Colorado Regent / State Board of Education (district seats):**
  1,500 or 10% of last primary (whichever is less) within that district
  ([Petition Signature Requirements](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/SignatureRequirements.html#:~:text=County%20Offices%201%2C000%20or%2010,whichever%20is%20less)).

When collecting signatures, remember they must be from **eligible Democratic
voters in the relevant district**
([Major Party Candidate Petition](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyPetition.html#:~:text=Only%20eligible%20electors%20registered%20as,5)).
Voters can only sign one candidate’s petition per office
([Major Party Candidate Petition](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyPetition.html#:~:text=Only%20eligible%20electors%20registered%20as,5)),
and an unaffiliated voter _cannot_ sign a Democratic petition
([Major Party Candidate Petition](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyPetition.html#:~:text=candidate%E2%80%99s%20petition%20for%20the%20same,5)).
It’s wise to collect well above the minimum number to account for any invalid or
disqualified signatures. Always use the official petition format provided by the
Secretary of State and follow all instructions for circulators (e.g. circulator
must sign an affidavit for each petition section). Once signatures are submitted
by the deadline, the Secretary of State will conduct verification and inform you
if you qualified
([Major Party Candidate Petition](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyPetition.html#:~:text=5,Name%20placed%20on%20ballot))
([Major Party Candidate Petition](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyPetition.html#:~:text=A%20candidate%20that%20failed%20to,2)).

### Campaign Finance Regulations and Reporting

Campaign finance laws in Colorado are strict and apply to all candidates (with
separate rules at the federal level for U.S. Congress). Key points include:

- **Registration and Reporting:** All candidates who raise or spend money
  (beyond personal funds) **must register a candidate committee** with the
  Colorado Secretary of State and file periodic disclosure reports
  ([State Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/state.html#:~:text=Step%204%3A%20Register%20a%20candidate,are%20you%20a%20standalone%20candidate))
  ([State Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/state.html#:~:text=Step%208%3A%20File%20campaign%20finance,disclosure%20reports)).
  Registration is done through the TRACER system (the online campaign finance
  portal)
  ([State Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/state.html#:~:text=Step%204%3A%20Register%20a%20candidate,are%20you%20a%20standalone%20candidate)).
  Even if you’re running unopposed or for a local office, if you have
  contributions or expenses, you need to file. The Secretary of State provides
  filing calendars for when reports (quarterly, monthly, or biweekly near the
  election) are due
  ([State Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/state.html#:~:text=1700%20Broadway%2C%20Suite%20550%20Denver%2C,gov)).
  **Timely filing is critical** – late filings incur fines
  ([State Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/state.html#:~:text=1700%20Broadway%2C%20Suite%20550%20Denver%2C,gov)).

- **Contribution Limits:** Colorado law (Article XXVIII of the state
  constitution and the Fair Campaign Practices Act) sets dollar limits on
  contributions to candidates. For example, as of the current cycle, a state
  legislative candidate can accept around $400 per donor per election (primary
  and general counted separately), and statewide candidates around $1,250 per
  donor, among other limits (figures adjust periodically for inflation).
  Candidates can also choose to accept voluntary spending limits for certain
  offices
  ([State Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/state.html#:~:text=2,XXVIII%20of%20the%20Colorado%20Constitution)),
  which, if accepted, must be declared on the candidate affidavit. Be sure to
  review the **Colorado Constitution Article XXVIII and Title 1, Article 45,
  C.R.S.** (the Fair Campaign Practices Act) for specifics
  ([State Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/state.html#:~:text=Candidates%20are%20required%20to%20understand,comply%20with%20the%20following%20provisions)).
  These are included in the candidate packet and available on the SOS website
  ([State Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/state.html#:~:text=Candidates%20are%20required%20to%20understand,comply%20with%20the%20following%20provisions)).

- **Campaign Finance Training:** The Secretary of State offers a free campaign
  finance training manual
  ([Candidate FAQs](https://www.coloradosos.gov/pubs/elections/FAQs/Candidate.html#:~:text=Q4,the%20Fair%20Campaign%20Practices%20Act))
  and other guidance to help candidates comply. It’s highly recommended to study
  these resources. You must understand what counts as a contribution or
  expenditure, how to report donations, and the rules on political advertising
  disclosures, etc.
  ([State Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/state.html#:~:text=Candidates%20must%20meet%20the%20basic,qualifications%20for%20office))
  ([State Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/state.html#:~:text=Step%206%3A%20File%20a%20candidate,voluntary%20spending%20acceptance%2C%20if%20applicable)).

- **Federal Candidates:** If you are running for U.S. House or U.S. Senate, you
  fall under **federal campaign finance law**. This means you must register with
  the Federal Election Commission (FEC) (filing an FEC Form 1 to create a
  committee and Form 2 to declare your candidacy) and follow federal
  contribution limits and quarterly reporting to the FEC. The Colorado Secretary
  of State explicitly advises federal candidates to contact the FEC for all
  campaign finance requirements
  ([Federal Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/federal.html#:~:text=))
  ([Federal Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/federal.html#:~:text=state%20level)).
  The FEC can be reached at 1-800-424-9530 or via www.fec.gov
  ([Federal Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/federal.html#:~:text=state%20level)).
  (Note: You may still need to file some state forms, like a ballot access
  acceptance, but your fundraising/reporting is governed by the FEC.)

- **Local/Municipal Candidates:** Campaign finance for municipal races in
  Colorado can be governed by state law or by local ordinances, depending on if
  the city has its own rules. Many Colorado cities have adopted their own
  campaign finance regulations (for instance, Denver has its own reporting
  system and limits). If running in a municipal election, check with the city
  clerk on where to file campaign finance reports. If no local system exists,
  you may be required to file with the state TRACER system. County offices and
  special district candidates file through the state system (unless it’s a small
  local election exempted). The candidate packet from the state will clarify
  this, or the county clerk can guide you
  ([County Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/county.html#:~:text=Contact%20your%20county%20clerk%E2%80%99s%20office,running%20for%20a%20county%20office))
  ([Candidate FAQs](https://www.coloradosos.gov/pubs/elections/FAQs/Candidate.html#:~:text=Candidates%20for%20municipal%20office%20should,they%20are%20running%20for%20office)).

In summary, all candidates should budget time to handle campaign finance
compliance. File your **Candidate Affidavit** within 10 days of qualifying as a
candidate
([State Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/state.html#:~:text=Step%206%3A%20File%20a%20candidate,voluntary%20spending%20acceptance%2C%20if%20applicable)),
register your committee before raising money
([County Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/county.html#:~:text=A%20candidate%20committee%20is%20required,are%20therefore%20a%20standalone%20candidate)),
and file all required disclosure reports on time
([State Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/state.html#:~:text=1700%20Broadway%2C%20Suite%20550%20Denver%2C,gov)).
Campaign finance violations can result in fines or even disqualification, so
take this aspect seriously.

### Party-Specific Requirements and Processes

Running “as a Democrat” means you’ll engage with the Colorado Democratic Party’s
mechanisms for candidate selection and may seek party support. Here are the key
party-specific elements:

- **Party Affiliation & Endorsement:** As mentioned, you must be a registered
  Democrat by early January of the election year to run in the Democratic
  primary
  ([Major Party Candidate Petition](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyPetition.html#:~:text=Candidates%20must%20meet%20the%20basic,qualifications%20for%20office)).
  The **Colorado Democratic Party generally does not allow official endorsements
  in contested primaries** beyond the assembly vote. The party’s “endorsement”
  effectively comes via the assembly process—if you win 30% or more delegate
  support, you earn the party’s official designation onto the primary ballot
  ([Major Party Assembly Designation](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyAssembly.html#:~:text=Candidates%20who%20wish%20to%20gain,2)).
  The party itself (state or county level) typically remains neutral if there’s
  a primary contest, supporting whoever emerges as the nominee. After the
  primary, the Democratic Party will back the nominee with resources and
  coordinated campaigning.

- **Precinct Caucus and Delegate Selection:** Because Colorado Democrats use the
  caucus & assembly system, as a candidate you should work within that system.
  That means recruiting supporters to attend the **precinct caucuses (held in
  the first week of March)** to become delegates for you
  ([2024 Election Calendar](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/calendars/2024ElectionCalendar.pdf#:~:text=Secretary%20of%20State%20Presidential%20Primary,clerk%20and%20recorder%20of%20each))
  ([Caucuses, Assemblies and Conventions FAQs](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/FAQs/caucuses.html#:~:text=A1,are%20open%20to%20the%20public)).
  Each registered Democrat can participate in their precinct caucus (including
  16- and 17-year-olds who preregister as Democrats, per party rule)
  ([Caucuses, Assemblies and Conventions FAQs](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/FAQs/caucuses.html#:~:text=A%20pre,may%20vote%20at%20the%20caucus)).
  Delegates then advance to county or higher assemblies where they vote on
  candidate nominations. Understanding this process and engaging with party
  activists at caucuses can be crucial if you pursue the assembly route.

- **Party Assemblies/Conventions:** The **Colorado Democratic State Assembly**
  (and relevant county/multi-county assemblies) is where Democratic candidates
  are formally nominated for the primary ballot by delegate vote
  ([Major Party Assembly Designation](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyAssembly.html#:~:text=Major%20political%20party%20candidates%20may,5)).
  The Democratic Party will set the dates for these assemblies (by statute, no
  later than 73 days before the primary)
  ([Major Party Assembly Designation](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyAssembly.html#:~:text=Major%20political%20party%20candidates%20may,5)).
  Stay in close contact with party officials to know the schedule. Also, note
  the requirement to **notify party leadership at least 30 days before the
  assembly** if you seek to be considered for nomination
  ([Major Party Assembly Designation](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyAssembly.html#:~:text=party%20protocol%2C%20announcements%2C%20party%20campaign,rules%2C%20etc)).
  For example, if a county assembly is on March 30, a candidate should inform
  the County Democratic Chair by late February of their intention to run at the
  assembly.

- **Primary Election Rules:** Colorado’s primary elections are run by the state
  (held in June), and the Democratic primary is open to any registered Democrat
  and unaffiliated voters (who have not chosen another party’s ballot)
  ([Major Party Candidate Petition](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyPetition.html#:~:text=Only%20eligible%20electors%20registered%20as,5)).
  As a candidate, you should be aware that you’ll be appealing not just to
  Democrats but also to unaffiliated voters who choose the Democratic ballot.
  Winning the primary requires a simple plurality – there is no runoff, even if
  the field is multi-candidate. Also, if you are unopposed in the primary, you
  automatically become the nominee (the primary is still held, but with your
  name alone, or in some cases the race might not appear if uncontested due to
  state rules).

- **Post-Primary Party Support:** Once you become the Democratic nominee (either
  by winning the primary or being unopposed), the state and local Democratic
  Party organizations will typically assist your campaign for the general
  election. This may include coordinated campaign efforts, inclusion in party
  voter guides, fundraising support, etc. While this is not a “requirement,”
  it’s a benefit of running as a major party candidate.

- **Democratic Party Platform and Values:** While not a procedural requirement,
  it’s wise to familiarize yourself with the Colorado Democratic Party’s
  platform and rules. Candidates may be asked to adhere to certain standards or
  participate in party forums. In some cases (especially local nonpartisan
  races), county Democratic parties may “endorse” or support candidates who
  align with Democratic values, even if the race isn’t labeled by party. Contact
  your local Democratic Party for any such processes (for example, county
  Democrats might endorse in school board or city races).

In short, running as a Democrat means working within an established party
framework: caucuses and assemblies for ballot access, primaries for voter
selection, and party committees that can offer guidance and support. It’s
beneficial to reach out to party leaders early – they can explain the
caucus/assembly details and may provide training for candidates on how to
navigate these events
([Major Party Assembly Designation](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyAssembly.html#:~:text=Step%202%3A%20Contact%20Your%20Political,Party))
([Major Party Assembly Designation](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/MajorPartyAssembly.html#:~:text=Potential%20candidates%20should%20contact%20their,announcements%2C%20party%20campaign%20rules%2C%20etc)).

### Resources and Contacts

When running for office, make use of the following official resources and
contacts for accurate information and assistance:

- **Colorado Secretary of State – Elections Division:** The Colorado SOS is the
  primary source for election forms, calendars, and rules. Their website’s
  candidate section includes guides on how to run for various offices, candidate
  qualification details, petition templates, and campaign finance information
  ([Candidate FAQs](https://www.coloradosos.gov/pubs/elections/FAQs/Candidate.html#:~:text=Q1,started))
  ([Candidate FAQs](https://www.coloradosos.gov/pubs/elections/FAQs/Candidate.html#:~:text=Q3,for%20candidacy)).

    ([State Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/state.html#:~:text=Colorado%20Secretary%20of%20State%20Attention%3A,gov)).

- **County Clerk & Recorder Offices:** If you’re running for a **county office
  or a single-county state legislative seat**, your county clerk is a vital
  resource. They provide information on local candidate qualifications, required
  forms (like assembly nomination forms or petition formats), and will often run
  the primary and general election in that county
  ([County Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/county.html#:~:text=Contact%20your%20county%20clerk%E2%80%99s%20office,running%20for%20a%20county%20office)).
  The Colorado Secretary of State provides a [County Clerk contact list】
  ([County Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/county.html#:~:text=formats%2C%20etc,running%20for%20a%20county%20office))
  – use this to find your local election office. Similarly, for **municipal
  elections**, contact the **City or Town Clerk** for candidate packets and
  local election codes
  ([Candidate FAQs](https://www.coloradosos.gov/pubs/elections/FAQs/Candidate.html#:~:text=A2,documents%20relating%20to%20your%20candidacy)).

- **Colorado Democratic Party:** The state party headquarters can offer guidance
  on the caucus and assembly process, party rules, and connect you with county
  party leaders. They often have resources for candidates (especially
  first-timers) on navigating party nomination.

    (Look for a “Run for Office” or “Candidates” section. For example, the
    Colorado Dems site often lists current candidate resources or training
    opportunities.)

- **Local Democratic Party Offices:** Each county in Colorado has a Democratic
  Party organization. These are useful for building volunteer support and
  learning local procedures. For instance, Denver Democrats or El Paso County
  Democrats will know the ins-and-outs of running in their areas. The state
  party can direct you to the appropriate county party chair, or you can find
  contacts via the state party’s directory.

- **Federal Election Commission (FEC):** If running for U.S. House or Senate,
  the FEC will be your go-to for campaign finance registration and reporting.
  They have beginner guides for congressional candidates.
  - _Website:_ [www.fec.gov](https://www.fec.gov)
    ([Federal Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/federal.html#:~:text=state%20level))
  - _Toll-Free:_ 1-800-424-9530
    ([Federal Candidates](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Candidates/federal.html#:~:text=Federal%20Election%20Commission%201050%20First,9530%20Website%3A%20www.fec.gov))
  - _Info:_ Provides the Candidate Registration handbook, deadlines for FEC
    reports, and a phone help desk for questions.

- **Candidate Training and Reference Materials:** Consider reviewing
  non-partisan resources like Ballotpedia’s “Ballot access requirements for
  candidates in Colorado” for summaries of laws, or guides from civic groups.
  However, always cross-reference with official Colorado SOS information to
  ensure accuracy. The Colorado SOS offers a **candidate packet** with all
  necessary forms and guidelines (available online or by request)
  ([Candidate FAQs](https://www.coloradosos.gov/pubs/elections/FAQs/Candidate.html#:~:text=Q1,started)),
  and a **campaign finance training manual**
  ([Candidate FAQs](https://www.coloradosos.gov/pubs/elections/FAQs/Candidate.html#:~:text=Q4,the%20Fair%20Campaign%20Practices%20Act))
  – both are extremely helpful in making sure you don’t miss any steps.

- **Legal References:** If you need to dig into the laws: Colorado’s election
  laws are primarily in Title 1 of the Colorado Revised Statutes. Key sections
  include 1-4-601 et seq. (party nominations), 1-4-801/802 (petitions), and
  Article XXVIII of the Colorado Constitution (campaign finance). The Secretary
  of State’s rules (8 CCR 1505-1) also clarify many procedures. These are
  available on the SOS website or through the state’s online statute database.

Finally, don’t hesitate to ask questions. The Secretary of State’s elections
staff can clarify filing questions, and party officials can clarify
caucus/assembly rules. By meeting all requirements – from age and residency
qualifications to filing the proper forms by their deadlines – and by following
Democratic Party processes for nomination, you’ll position yourself to run a
compliant and successful campaign. Good luck on your journey to public office!

Below is a comprehensive overview to help prospective candidates understand the
steps to get on the ballot as a Democrat in Pittsburgh, PA.

### Eligibility Requirements for Office

**Pittsburgh Local Offices (City & County):** To run for a Pittsburgh city
office (such as Mayor, City Controller, or City Council) or an Allegheny County
office, you generally must be an eligible voter residing in the relevant
jurisdiction. In practice this means being at least 18 years old, a U.S.
citizen, and a **resident of the city/county for at least one year** before the
election
([PA primary election 2025: How to run for local public office • Spotlight PA](https://www.spotlightpa.org/statecollege/2025/02/pennsylvania-municipal-primary-election-local-government-elected-officials-nomination-petitions/#:~:text=Adult%20residents%20who%20have%20lived,this%20eligibility%20rule%20generally%20applies)).
The City of Pittsburgh Home Rule Charter further requires mayoral candidates to
have been city residents for at least **3 years immediately preceding the
election**
([City of Pittsburgh, PA EXECUTIVE BRANCH - eCode360](https://ecode360.com/45480685#:~:text=City%20of%20Pittsburgh%2C%20PA%20EXECUTIVE,preceding%20election%2C%20unless%20absent)).
City council candidates typically must reside in the council district they seek
to represent for at least one year as well. Allegheny County offices have
similar residency requirements (for example, the County Executive must be a
county resident for a period specified by the county charter, usually one year
or more). It’s also required to be a **registered Democrat** in order to run in
the Democratic primary – Pennsylvania has closed primaries, so both candidates
and petition signers must be registered members of the Democratic Party in that
district
([PA primary election 2025: How to run for local public office • Spotlight PA](https://www.spotlightpa.org/statecollege/2025/02/pennsylvania-municipal-primary-election-local-government-elected-officials-nomination-petitions/#:~:text=Special%20attention%20should%20be%20paid,signatures%20than%20what%20is%20required)).
(Note: School board and judicial candidates in Pennsylvania can _“cross-file”_
to run in multiple party primaries, but those races are officially nonpartisan;
if you choose to run as a Democrat in such races, you may still file in the
Democratic primary while also appearing on the Republican primary ballot.)

**Pennsylvania State Legislature:** Candidates for the **Pennsylvania General
Assembly** must meet age and residency criteria set by the state constitution.
For the **State House of Representatives**, you must be at least **21 years
old**, and for the **State Senate** at least **25 years old**
([Eligibility Requirements to Run for the State Legislature](https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/eligibility-requirements-to-run-for-the-state-legislature#:~:text=Senate))
([Pennsylvania State Senate - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_Senate#:~:text=)).
In addition, you must have been a **citizen and inhabitant of Pennsylvania for
at least 4 years**, and a resident of the district you wish to represent for at
least **1 year prior to the election**
([Eligibility Requirements to Run for the State Legislature](https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/eligibility-requirements-to-run-for-the-state-legislature#:~:text=House))
([Pennsylvania State Senate - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_Senate#:~:text=)).
These requirements ensure that state legislators have a connection to the
communities they represent. Like local offices, you’ll need to be a registered
Democrat to file for the Democratic primary. (State legislative candidates in PA
do not have term limits, but they must run for re-election every two years for
State House or four years for State Senate.)

**Pennsylvania Governor (and Statewide Offices):** To run for **Governor of
Pennsylvania** (or **Lieutenant Governor**, or statewide executive offices like
Attorney General), a candidate must be at least **30 years old** and have been a
**resident (inhabitant) of Pennsylvania for the last 7 years** leading up to the
election
([Chapter 4. - CONSTITUTION OF PENNSYLVANIA](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/CT/HTM/00/00.004..HTM#:~:text=No%20person%20shall%20be%20eligible,the%20Supreme%20Court%20of%20Pennsylvania)).
The Pennsylvania Constitution states: “No person shall be eligible to the office
of Governor… except a citizen of the United States, who has attained the age of
30 years, and have been seven years next preceding election an inhabitant of
this Commonwealth”
([Chapter 4. - CONSTITUTION OF PENNSYLVANIA](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/CT/HTM/00/00.004..HTM#:~:text=No%20person%20shall%20be%20eligible,the%20Supreme%20Court%20of%20Pennsylvania)).
(There is an exception if you were absent from the state on public business.)
Additionally, the Governor and Lt. Governor can serve a maximum of two
consecutive terms. As with other offices, being a registered Democrat is
required to run in the Democratic primary for governor. For other statewide
offices like **U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania**, the U.S. Constitution’s
requirements apply: at least **30 years old**, a U.S. citizen for at least 9
years, and an inhabitant of Pennsylvania at the time of the election
([A look at the candidates on the 2024 Pennsylvania ballot - The Brown and White](https://thebrownandwhite.com/2024/10/21/a-look-at-the-candidates-on-the-2024-pennsylvania-ballot/#:~:text=U)).
There are no state residency duration requirements for U.S. Senate beyond being
an “inhabitant” when elected.

**U.S. House of Representatives:** To run for the **U.S. House** in a
congressional district that includes Pittsburgh (currently Pennsylvania’s 12th
and 14th congressional districts cover Pittsburgh and surrounding areas), you
must meet the constitutional requirements: at least **25 years old**, at least 7
years a U.S. citizen, and an **inhabitant of Pennsylvania** (the state) when
elected
([Article I Section 2 | Constitution Annotated | Congress.gov | Library of Congress](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-2/#:~:text=Elections%20,which%20he%20shall%20be%20chosen)).
Unlike some state offices, there is no specific length of state residency
required beyond being an inhabitant; in practice, House candidates usually live
in or near the district they seek to represent, and **local residency** can be
politically important. You’ll need to be a registered Democrat to run in the
Democratic primary. U.S. Representatives serve two-year terms with no term
limits.

**U.S. Senate:** Running for one of Pennsylvania’s two seats in the **U.S.
Senate** also has constitutional requirements: you must be at least **30 years
old**, have at least 9 years of U.S. citizenship, and be an **inhabitant of
Pennsylvania** when elected
([Article I Section 3 | Constitution Annotated | Congress.gov | Library of Congress](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-3/#:~:text=,which%20he%20shall%20be%20chosen)).
(Pennsylvania’s U.S. Senate seats are elected statewide, not by district.) Like
the House, there’s no additional state-law requirement for how long you’ve lived
in the state, but a credible campaign for Senate typically assumes substantial
ties to Pennsylvania. U.S. Senators serve six-year terms (with one of
Pennsylvania’s two seats up for election every staggered cycle; for example, one
seat is up in 2024 and the other in 2028). As always, a Senate candidate running
as a Democrat must be a registered member of the Democratic Party to compete in
the primary.

### Filing Process and Deadlines

**Nominating Petitions and Primary Ballot Access:** Pennsylvania uses a partisan
primary system, so Democratic candidates gain access to the November general
election ballot by winning the **Democratic primary** (usually held in May of
the election year). To appear on the primary ballot, you must file **nominating
petitions** with the required number of signatures from registered Democratic
voters _and_ submit other required forms by the deadline. The **petition
circulation period** typically begins in mid-February of the election year and
lasts about three weeks. For example, for the 2025 municipal primary (which
includes Pittsburgh city and county offices), candidates could start collecting
signatures on **February 18, 2025**, and the **filing deadline** was 5:00 PM on
**March 11, 2025**
([Running for Office | Department of State | Commonwealth of Pennsylvania](https://www.pa.gov/agencies/dos/programs/voting-and-elections/running-for-office.html#:~:text=))
([Candidate and Municipality Resources - Allegheny County, PA](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Government/Elections/Candidate-and-Municipality-Resources#:~:text=Nomination%20Petitions)).
(These dates shift each cycle; for a **2026** election, the window will likely
be mid-February to early March 2026 – always check the official election
calendar for exact dates.)

- **Where to File:** Candidates for **statewide or multi-county offices**
  (Governor, U.S. Senate, U.S. House, state legislature, etc.) file their
  petitions and paperwork with the Pennsylvania Department of State’s Bureau of
  Commissions, Elections and Legislation in Harrisburg
  ([Running for Office | Department of State | Commonwealth of Pennsylvania](https://www.pa.gov/agencies/dos/programs/voting-and-elections/running-for-office.html#:~:text=,Financial%20Interests%20with%20the%20State)).
  Candidates for **local offices that are confined to one county** (e.g.
  Pittsburgh Mayor, City Council, or Allegheny County offices) file with the
  **Allegheny County Elections Division**
  ([Candidate and Municipality Resources - Allegheny County, PA](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Government/Elections/Candidate-and-Municipality-Resources#:~:text=All%20required%20materials%20must%20be,at%20the%20Elections%20Division%20office)).
  The Allegheny County Elections Division is located at 542 Forbes Avenue, Room
  326, Pittsburgh, PA 15219
  ([Candidate and Municipality Resources - Allegheny County, PA](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Government/Elections/Candidate-and-Municipality-Resources#:~:text=Elections%20Division%20County%20Office%20Building,icon%20for%20linked%20directionsGoogle%20Directions)),
  and it provides petition forms and candidate packets for local races.
  Petitions _must be submitted on time_ – Pennsylvania law sets a hard deadline,
  and **late filings are not accepted**.

- **Signature Requirements:** Each office requires a minimum number of
  signatures from registered voters of the candidate’s party. Pennsylvania’s
  Election Code specifies these numbers (and they were updated in 2019 to make
  ballot access easier in many cases). Key requirements include: **2,000
  signatures** for statewide offices like Governor and U.S. Senator (Governor
  also requires that the signatures include at least 100 from each of at least
  10 different counties)
  ([Section 2872.1 - Number of signers required for nomination petitions of candidates at primaries, 25 Pa.

  **500** for State Senate
  ([Section 2872.1 - Number of signers required for nomination petitions of candidates at primaries, 25 Pa.

  Local offices have lower thresholds: for example, **Allegheny County-wide
  offices** (county executive, county controller, etc.) require **500**
  signatures (Allegheny is a “second class” county)
  ([Section 2872.1 - Number of signers required for nomination petitions of candidates at primaries, 25 Pa.

  **Pittsburgh citywide offices** (Mayor or Controller) require **250**
  signatures (Pittsburgh is a city of the second class)
  ([Section 2872.1 - Number of signers required for nomination petitions of candidates at primaries, 25 Pa. Stat. § 2872.1 | Casetext Search + Citator](https://casetext.com/statute/pennsylvania-statutes/statutes-unconsolidated/title-25-ps-elections-electoral-districts/chapter-14-election-code/article-ix-nomination-of-candidates/nomination-of-party-candidates-at-primaries/section-28721-number-of-signers-required-for-nomination-petitions-of-candidates-at-primaries#:~:text=or%20party%20offices%20to%20be,25%29%20Public));
  and **Pittsburgh City Council district seats** require only **100** signatures
  from that council district
  ([Section 2872.1 - Number of signers required for nomination petitions of candidates at primaries, 25 Pa. Stat. § 2872.1 | Casetext Search + Citator](https://casetext.com/statute/pennsylvania-statutes/statutes-unconsolidated/title-25-ps-elections-electoral-districts/chapter-14-election-code/article-ix-nomination-of-candidates/nomination-of-party-candidates-at-primaries/section-28721-number-of-signers-required-for-nomination-petitions-of-candidates-at-primaries#:~:text=or%20second%20class%3A%20Two%20hundred,A%20sitting)).
  Minor local offices like **school board director** or party committee posts
  often need just 10 signatures (indeed, “all other” local offices default to a
  **10 signature** requirement by state law)
  ([Section 2872.1 - Number of signers required for nomination petitions of candidates at primaries, 25 Pa. Stat. § 2872.1 | Casetext Search + Citator](https://casetext.com/statute/pennsylvania-statutes/statutes-unconsolidated/title-25-ps-elections-electoral-districts/chapter-14-election-code/article-ix-nomination-of-candidates/nomination-of-party-candidates-at-primaries/section-28721-number-of-signers-required-for-nomination-petitions-of-candidates-at-primaries#:~:text=magisterial%20district%20judge%20may%20not,public%20and%20party%20offices%3A%20Ten)).
  It’s recommended to collect **more than the minimum** (often 1.5 to 2 times
  the number) to cushion against any signers who might be disqualified (e.g. not
  registered at the address given, or not registered Democrat, etc.)
  ([PA primary election 2025: How to run for local public office • Spotlight PA](https://www.spotlightpa.org/statecollege/2025/02/pennsylvania-municipal-primary-election-local-government-elected-officials-nomination-petitions/#:~:text=Special%20attention%20should%20be%20paid,signatures%20than%20what%20is%20required)).
  All signatures must be gathered **within the circulation period** – any dated
  outside that window (before the start date or after the deadline) will not
  count
  ([Running for Office | Department of State | Commonwealth of Pennsylvania](https://www.pa.gov/agencies/dos/programs/voting-and-elections/running-for-office.html#:~:text=page%20after%20signatures%20are%20gathered,to%20circulate%20or%20after%20the)).

- **Other Filing Documents:** Along with petitions, candidates must submit a
  notarized **Candidate’s Affidavit** (attesting to their eligibility and party
  affiliation) and often a **Statement of Financial Interests** (for state/local
  offices) by the deadline
  ([Running for Office | Department of State | Commonwealth of Pennsylvania](https://www.pa.gov/agencies/dos/programs/voting-and-elections/running-for-office.html#:~:text=,the%20nomination%20petition%20filing%20deadline)).
  The Statement of Financial Interests is a form filed with the State Ethics
  Commission disclosing personal financial information; a copy must be attached
  to the nominating petition, and the original filed with the Ethics Commission
  by the petition deadline
  ([Running for Office | Department of State | Commonwealth of Pennsylvania](https://www.pa.gov/agencies/dos/programs/voting-and-elections/running-for-office.html#:~:text=Affidavit%2C%20an%20Unsworn%20Declaration%20must,a%20certified%20check%20or%20money)).
  (Federal candidates are exempt from the state financial interest filing, but
  federal law requires its own financial disclosure later on.) A **filing fee**
  is also required for most offices, paid via certified check or money order to
  the Commonwealth of PA. For example, the fee is typically $200 for Governor
  and U.S. Senate, $150 for U.S. House, $100 for state legislature, etc. (the
  Allegheny County “Elective Office Requirements” document lists each office’s
  fee alongside signature requirements). In Allegheny County, local offices have
  smaller fees (often $50 or so for city council). Be sure to check the latest
  fee schedule and include the check with your petition – petitions without the
  required fee will be rejected
  ([Running for Office | Department of State | Commonwealth of Pennsylvania](https://www.pa.gov/agencies/dos/programs/voting-and-elections/running-for-office.html#:~:text=,and%20cash%20cannot%20be%20accepted)).

- **Primary vs. General Election:** Running as a Democrat usually means going
  through the primary. If you were to bypass the primary and run as an
  independent or third-party candidate in the general election, the process is
  different (you’d use “nomination papers” instead of party nominating
  petitions, and the signature requirements are often higher for independents –
  e.g. statewide independents need thousands more signatures). However, since
  this guide focuses on running _as a Democrat_, the assumption is you will
  compete in the Democratic primary and, if successful, appear as the Democratic
  nominee on the November ballot. Primary winners are certified by the
  Department of State or County and automatically placed on the general election
  ballot – no additional signatures are needed for the general election. _(Note:
  Pennsylvania’s primary is typically in May for both even-year and odd-year
  elections, except in presidential years when it can be in April. In 2024, for
  example, the primary is scheduled for April 23, 2024, which moves the petition
  window slightly earlier. Always verify the election calendar for the exact
  primary date and corresponding deadlines.)_

### Campaign Finance Regulations and Reporting

**State and Local Campaign Finance (PA Law):** Once you’ve filed and become a
candidate, you must follow campaign finance laws governing fundraising and
spending. Pennsylvania’s state campaign finance laws require **periodic
disclosure reports** of all campaign contributions and expenditures. **All
candidates and their committees must file reports** with the appropriate office
– for state-level candidates (e.g. state House/Senate, governor) this is with
the Pennsylvania Department of State, and for local candidates (Pittsburgh city
or Allegheny County offices) this is with the Allegheny County Elections
Division
([Candidate and Municipality Resources - Allegheny County, PA](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Government/Elections/Candidate-and-Municipality-Resources#:~:text=Candidate%20Resources))
([Candidate and Municipality Resources - Allegheny County, PA](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Government/Elections/Candidate-and-Municipality-Resources#:~:text=,of%20Commissions%2C%20Elections%20and%20Legislation)).
In practice, when you file for office you will also organize a campaign
committee (even if it’s just yourself as treasurer) and register that committee.
Pennsylvania does **not impose contribution limits** on state or local
candidates (individuals and PACs can give unlimited amounts to state campaigns)
([Campaign finance requirements in Pennsylvania - Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Campaign_finance_requirements_in_Pennsylvania#:~:text=Ballotpedia%20ballotpedia,and%20to%20ballot%20measure%20campaigns)),
**except** that corporations and unions _cannot_ contribute directly to
candidates (they must form PACs for any direct political donations)
([1937 Act 320 - PA General Assembly](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/uconsCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&yr=1937&sessInd=0&smthLwInd=0&act=320&chpt=16#:~:text=Contributions%20for%20Election%20Expenses%20to,Corporations%20and%20Unincorporated%20Associations%20Prohibited)).
Despite the lack of state limits, the **City of Pittsburgh** has its own local
ordinance (Code Chapter 198) that _does_ set contribution limits for city
campaigns
([Running for City Elective Office?](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/bac/documents/ehb/running-for-city-elective-office.pdf#:~:text=Once%20you%20publicly%20announce%20that,on%20the%20use%20of%20political)).
For example, as of recent regulations, an individual’s donations to a Pittsburgh
mayoral candidate are capped (the city’s Ethics Board can provide the current
limit, which has been around $2,700 per year per person, indexed to inflation).
City candidates also have to file additional reports: Pittsburgh requires more
frequent pre-election reports (“early reporting requirements”) and has rules
about how candidates manage campaign accounts and committees
([Running for City Elective Office?](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/bac/documents/ehb/running-for-city-elective-office.pdf#:~:text=Once%20you%20publicly%20announce%20that,on%20the%20use%20of%20political)).
If you run for city office, be prepared to comply with both state filing
requirements _and_ Pittsburgh’s local campaign finance rules. The **Allegheny
County Elections Division** provides a “Campaign Finance Roadmap” and online
filing system for local candidates
([Candidate and Municipality Resources - Allegheny County, PA](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Government/Elections/Candidate-and-Municipality-Resources#:~:text=,of%20Commissions%2C%20Elections%20and%20Legislation)),
while the state provides an online filing system for state-level campaigns
([Candidate and Municipality Resources - Allegheny County, PA](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Government/Elections/Candidate-and-Municipality-Resources#:~:text=,of%20Commissions%2C%20Elections%20and%20Legislation)).

All candidates must file a series of reports, typically: **6th Tuesday
Pre-Primary**, **2nd Friday Pre-Primary**, **30-Day Post-Primary**, then the
same for the general election (6th Tuesday Pre-General, 2nd Friday Pre-General,
30-Day Post-General), plus an annual report for any year in which you continue
to have an open campaign account
([](https://www.montgomerycountypa.gov/DocumentCenter/View/48567/2025-County-and-MDJ-Packet#:~:text=highly%20recommend%20that%20candidates%20execute,listed%20below))
([](https://www.montgomerycountypa.gov/DocumentCenter/View/48567/2025-County-and-MDJ-Packet#:~:text=%EF%82%A7%20If%20you%20do%20not,by%20law%20to%20submit%20campaign)).
If you do not intend to raise or spend more than $250, you can file a **“Waiver
of Expense Reporting” affidavit** with your petition to skip regular reports
([](https://www.montgomerycountypa.gov/DocumentCenter/View/48567/2025-County-and-MDJ-Packet#:~:text=%EF%82%A7%20The%20Waiver%20relates%20to,250))
– but if you exceed $250 at any point, the waiver is void and you must file
reports. (Most serious campaigns will exceed $250 easily, so the waiver is
mainly for very small, shoestring candidacies or party committee candidates.)

**Federal Campaign Finance (U.S. House or Senate):** Candidates for U.S.
Congress are governed by federal law (the Federal Election Campaign Act) and
**must register with the Federal Election Commission (FEC)** once they raise or
spend over
$5,000. Federal candidates have contribution limits: individuals may donate up to **$3,300
per election** (primary and general count as separate elections) to a House or
Senate candidate, and PACs may donate up to $5,000 per election (these limits
are current for the 2024 cycle and indexed for inflation)
([City of Pittsburgh - File #: 2018-1159](https://pittsburgh.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3763251&GUID=EF776B8B-644E-4FB4-9FE0-ADA31196F9B3&Options=&Search=&FullText=1#:~:text=City%20of%20Pittsburgh%20,order%20to%20coordinate%20City)).
If you run for U.S. House or Senate, you’ll form a principal campaign committee
and begin filing regular FEC reports (quarterly, plus pre-primary, pre-general,
and post-general reports). Federal law preempts state law for campaign finance,
so the state’s no-limit rule does not apply – you must abide by federal limits
and source restrictions (no corporate or union treasury donations, no foreign
nationals, etc.). However, _state_ filing of a Statement of Financial Interests
is **not** required for federal candidates
([Running for Office | Department of State | Commonwealth of Pennsylvania](https://www.pa.gov/agencies/dos/programs/voting-and-elections/running-for-office.html#:~:text=signatures%20for%20the%20office%20you,Federal%20or%20Political%20Party%20offices)),
and you do not file state campaign finance reports. Instead, all reporting is
through the FEC. Keep in mind that federal candidates also must file personal
financial disclosure statements with the U.S. House or Senate ethics offices if
they become on-ballot candidates – this is separate from campaign finance and
occurs later in the campaign.

**Setting Up a Committee:** It’s wise (and often legally required) to set up a
dedicated **campaign bank account and committee** early on. For Pittsburgh city
offices, for example, the City’s Ethics Board advises that candidates should
**establish a political committee** to handle all funds
([Running for City Elective Office?](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/bac/documents/ehb/running-for-city-elective-office.pdf#:~:text=Most%20candidates%20accept%20and%20spend,on%20Behalf%20of%20a%20Candidate)).
You will file a _Political Committee Registration Statement_ and a _Candidate
Authorization_ form (allowing the committee to accept funds on your behalf) with
Allegheny County for local races
([Running for City Elective Office?](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/bac/documents/ehb/running-for-city-elective-office.pdf#:~:text=Most%20candidates%20accept%20and%20spend,on%20Behalf%20of%20a%20Candidate)).
Similar forms are filed at the state level for state candidates. All campaign
funds must be segregated in the campaign account, and spending should be for
bona fide campaign purposes. The City of Pittsburgh also prohibits using more
than one committee for a campaign and requires all contributions to go into the

**Reporting Tip:** Mark your calendar with all filing deadlines and don’t miss
them. Late or missing campaign finance reports in Pennsylvania can result in
fines and even potential ballot access issues (in extreme cases). Even if you
have **no activity**, you must file a $0 report by the deadline
([Running for City Elective Office?](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/bac/documents/ehb/running-for-city-elective-office.pdf#:~:text=1,you%20can%20find%20the%20agency%E2%80%99s))
(unless you are on a waiver). Both the state and county have websites where
filed reports are posted for public view
([Candidate and Municipality Resources - Allegheny County, PA](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Government/Elections/Candidate-and-Municipality-Resources#:~:text=Candidate%20Resources)),
meaning your fundraising will be transparent to the media and opponents. Keep
good records of all donations (name, address, employer for donors over $250) to
ensure your reports are complete.

### Party Endorsements, Primaries, and Conventions

Running “as a Democrat” means you’ll be part of the Democratic primary process.
**Pennsylvania’s primaries are closed**, so only registered Democrats can vote
to nominate Democratic candidates (and likewise only Republicans in the GOP
primary). As mentioned, you must be a registered Democrat to get on the Dem
primary ballot. Beyond these basics, there are some party-specific elements to
be aware of:

- **Local Party Endorsements:** The **Allegheny County Democratic Committee
  (ACDC)** often endorses candidates in contested primaries, especially for
  local offices and state legislative seats. In the winter before the primary
  (often February or early March), the committee’s members (local ward and
  precinct committee people) may hold an endorsement vote. An endorsed Democrat
  might get access to party resources like sample ballots, mailing lists, or
  volunteer support in the primary. However, endorsement is _not_ guaranteed –
  in some races the committee might choose not to endorse, especially if there
  are multiple credible Democrats. Endorsement is also not binding on voters;
  all Democratic primary voters can choose any candidate regardless of who the
  party officially endorsed. If you’re seeking office, it’s a good idea to reach
  out to the ACDC and campaign for their endorsement by contacting committee
  members. (For example, for a city council race, you might meet with committee
  people in your district before their endorsement vote.) While getting the
  party’s endorsement can provide a boost, lack of an endorsement doesn’t bar
  you from running – many candidates run in primaries without it, and some still
  win the nomination. The endorsement process is **internal to the party**; to
  learn about it, you can contact the Allegheny County Democratic Committee
  headquarters or attend their endorsement meeting if permitted.

- **State Party Endorsements:** For statewide races (Governor, U.S. Senate,
  etc.), the **Pennsylvania Democratic State Committee** may hold an endorsement
  vote at a winter meeting in the election year. If a candidate receives the
  endorsement of the State Committee, they can tout that in their campaign. Like
  local endorsements, it’s a show of party establishment support. But notably,
  in high-profile races (e.g. an open governor’s race), the state party
  sometimes chooses **not** to endorse, allowing all Democrats to compete freely
  in the primary. The endorsement is decided by hundreds of State Committee
  members from across PA. As a new candidate, obtaining state committee
  endorsement would involve a statewide effort to court those members. Keep in
  mind, however, that **the primary election is what actually decides the
  nominee** – endorsements are essentially party recommendations and can be
  overcome by a strong campaign. The Democratic Party in PA does not use a
  convention to _choose_ nominees (unlike some states); the nominee is chosen by
  voters in the primary, not by delegates. So, **there is no nominating
  convention** you must win – only the primary election. (The exception is if a
  vacancy occurs or no one files for a position, in which case party committees
  may convene to nominate a replacement candidate for the general election.)

- **Democratic National Convention (DNC):** This is only relevant if you are
  aiming for President or Vice President. If you were running for President,
  you’d be participating in the presidential primary and delegate selection
  process leading up to the Democratic National Convention. For all other
  offices, the DNC and national convention don’t play a role in your nomination.
  However, as a Democratic candidate, you should be aware of the **platform and
  values of the party** and may be asked about them. Aligning with party values
  can help in securing endorsements from Democratic-aligned groups and appealing
  to primary voters.

- **Party Resources and Support:** Beyond endorsements, the Democratic Party
  apparatus can provide support such as voter data, training, and volunteers.
  The **Allegheny County Democratic Committee** and various Democratic clubs in
  Pittsburgh (like Young Democrats, constituency caucuses, etc.) often hold
  events where candidates can speak. There are also campaign trainings offered
  by groups like **Pennsylvania Democratic Party** or third-parties (for
  example, nonprofits like Run for Something, EMILY’s List (for pro-choice
  Democratic women), or Labor unions) that Democratic candidates can tap into.
  While the party can’t legally contribute unlimited funds to you (there are
  some limits on party contributions at certain levels), they can coordinate
  campaign efforts once you’re the nominee. In the primary, expect that you’ll
  largely be running your own campaign, but you should still introduce yourself
  to party leaders. The Allegheny County Democratic headquarters can be a point
  of contact to get connected. State Committee members from your area (there are
  elected Democratic State Committee members in Allegheny County) might also be
  good contacts for advice and support.

- **Primary Election Day:** If you make the ballot, the primary typically occurs
  on the **third Tuesday in May** (except in presidential years, when it might
  be in April – in 2024 it’s April 23). On primary day, only Democrats can vote
  for you. To win, it’s simply a plurality – whoever gets the most votes wins
  the party nomination (no runoffs in PA). After the primary, the party usually
  unites behind the nominee. For example, if you and another Democrat fiercely
  competed, the loser would normally endorse the winner for the general
  election. The County and State Democratic Party will then offer full support
  to the nominee (coordinating voter outreach, etc., especially in big races).

### Resources and Key Contacts

Navigating a campaign can be complex, but there are many official resources to
assist you. Below is a list of helpful contacts and references for running in
Pittsburgh/PA:

- **Pennsylvania Department of State – Elections Division:** This state agency
  oversees elections and candidate filings. Their website’s “Running for Office”
  section
  ([Running for Office | Department of State | Commonwealth of Pennsylvania](https://www.pa.gov/agencies/dos/programs/voting-and-elections/running-for-office.html#:~:text=))
  ([Running for Office | Department of State | Commonwealth of Pennsylvania](https://www.pa.gov/agencies/dos/programs/voting-and-elections/running-for-office.html#:~:text=,Financial%20Interests%20with%20the%20State))
  provides candidate guides, an official election calendar, and the online
  portal for obtaining petition forms. You can contact the PA Dept. of State’s
  Bureau of Elections at **717-787-5280** or toll-free **1-877-868-3772
  (option 3)** for candidate queries
  ([Running for Office | Department of State | Commonwealth of Pennsylvania](https://www.pa.gov/agencies/dos/programs/voting-and-elections/running-for-office.html#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20questions%20about,3772%2C%20option%203)).
  Key documents like the **2025 Election Calendar**
  ([PA primary election 2025: How to run for local public office • Spotlight PA](https://www.spotlightpa.org/statecollege/2025/02/pennsylvania-municipal-primary-election-local-government-elected-officials-nomination-petitions/#:~:text=of%20this%20process))
  and the “Official Vacancy List” (showing offices up for election)
  ([Running for Office | Department of State | Commonwealth of Pennsylvania](https://www.pa.gov/agencies/dos/programs/voting-and-elections/running-for-office.html#:~:text=2025%20PETITION%20FILING%20PERIOD%3A%20FEBRUARY,MARCH%2011%2C%202025))
  are published there.

- **Allegheny County Elections Division:** For Pittsburgh city and Allegheny
  County offices, the county’s Elections Division is your go-to for petitions
  and filing. They are located in the **County Office Building, 542 Forbes Ave,
  Room 326, Pittsburgh, PA 15219**
  ([Candidate and Municipality Resources - Allegheny County, PA](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Government/Elections/Candidate-and-Municipality-Resources#:~:text=Elections%20Division%20County%20Office%20Building,icon%20for%20linked%20directionsGoogle%20Directions)).
  The Elections Division provides downloadable **candidate packets** (including
  petition forms specific to each office and detailed instructions) on their
  website
  ([Candidate and Municipality Resources - Allegheny County, PA](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Government/Elections/Candidate-and-Municipality-Resources#:~:text=Instructions%20and%20Support%20Documentation)).
  In 2025, for instance, the county posted the “Instructions and Regulations for
  Nomination Petitions” and forms like the **Candidate’s Affidavit** on its site
  ([Candidate and Municipality Resources - Allegheny County, PA](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Government/Elections/Candidate-and-Municipality-Resources#:~:text=,Judge%20or%20Inspector%20of%20Election)).
  You can pick up physical petition forms at their office as well. The phone
  number is 412-350-4500 (or the county’s general info line at 412-350-4636)
  ([Candidate and Municipality Resources - Allegheny County, PA](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Government/Elections/Candidate-and-Municipality-Resources#:~:text=436%20Grant%20Street%20Pittsburgh%2C%20PA,15219%20View%20on%20Map)).
  The staff can answer technical questions about filing paperwork, filing fees,
  and election district information. Allegheny County’s website also has a
  **“Candidate & Municipality Resources”** page
  ([Candidate and Municipality Resources - Allegheny County, PA](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Government/Elections/Candidate-and-Municipality-Resources#:~:text=Candidate%20Resources))
  with links to campaign finance filing systems and more.

- **Pennsylvania State Ethics Commission:** All state and local candidates
  (except federal offices) must file a **Statement of Financial Interests**. The
  State Ethics Commission in Harrisburg receives those forms. You can find the
  form on the Ethics Commission website or via links provided in the candidate
  packets
  ([Candidate and Municipality Resources - Allegheny County, PA](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Government/Elections/Candidate-and-Municipality-Resources#:~:text=,Judge%20or%20Inspector%20of%20Election)).
  If you have questions about how to fill out the financial interest form,
  contact the Ethics Commission at 717-783-1610 or 1-800-932-0936. Failing to
  file this form by the deadline is one of the most common technicalities that
  can get a candidate removed from the ballot, so utilize this resource to do it
  correctly.

- **Federal Election Commission (FEC):** For U.S. House or Senate campaigns,
  consult the FEC for guidance on registering your campaign committee (Form 2
  for candidacy and Form 1 for your committee). The FEC’s website, fec.gov, has
  brochures for House and Senate candidates and a toll-free info line
  1-800-424-9530. While local party offices may help to an extent, federal
  compliance is a specialized area – make sure you download the **FEC Campaign
  Guide for Congressional Candidates** and follow all rules on disclaimers,
  contribution limits, and quarterly reporting.

- **Democratic Party Organizations:**
  - _Allegheny County Democratic Committee (ACDC):_ The ACDC can be a valuable
    source of local support and information. Their office is in Pittsburgh
    (often at the IBEW building on the South Side as of recent years). They
    maintain a website and Facebook page where they announce endorsement
    meetings and committee contacts. As a candidate, you might reach out to the
    ACDC Chair or Executive Director to introduce your campaign. They can inform
    you of any candidate forums or meet-and-greets with committee members. The
    committee’s endorsement rules and voting process are typically in their
    bylaws – don’t hesitate to ask the party leadership how it works and what
    the timeline is.
  - _Pennsylvania Democratic Party:_ The state party (PADems) headquarters is in
    Harrisburg. They have resources like voter data (VoteBuilder access) that
    they can extend to Democratic campaigns. After you file, you can request
    access to the party’s voter file system, which is often provided either for
    free or at a reduced cost to Democratic nominees or candidates. The PADems
    also sometimes run candidate training programs in coordination with groups
    like the National Democratic Training Committee. Check **padems.com** for
    contacts.
  - _Democratic Caucus Campaign Committees:_ For state legislative races, the
    House Democratic Campaign Committee (HDCC) and Senate Democratic Campaign
    Committee (SDCC) focus on electing Democrats to the General Assembly. They
    may or may not get involved in primaries, but if you win the primary (or are
    running in a key district), they can offer general election support (field
    organizers, funding, etc.). It can be useful to connect with them early –
    for example, HDCC often tracks who is running in each district. They can
    sometimes provide advice or data in the primary as well (especially if
    you’re running against an incumbent or in an open seat that they consider
    important).
  - _Other Democratic Groups:_ Don’t forget Pittsburgh has active chapters of
    groups like the **Young Democrats**, college Democrats (if you’re on or near
    a campus), Democratic women’s groups, labor union councils, and issue-based
    caucuses. Engaging with organizations such as the **League of Women Voters**
    (nonpartisan, but host candidate forums), or the **Urban League Young
    Professionals**, etc., can give you exposure and credibility. While not
    official party bodies, these groups often intersect with Democratic voters
    and can help you network.

- **Informational Resources:**
  - The **Pennsylvania Candidate Guide** (issued by the Department of State each
    year) – this PDF is a must-read, as it summarizes all requirements,
    deadlines, and procedures.
  - **Ballotpedia** – Ballotpedia.org has pages on “Ballot access requirements
    in Pennsylvania” and specific pages for “Mayor of Pittsburgh election
    [Year]” or “Pennsylvania House District [xx] election [Year]” which can give
    a summary of how to file, past election results, etc. While not an official
    source, Ballotpedia is generally accurate and can be a quick reference.
  - **Spotlight PA and Local Media** – In the lead-up to petition season,
    outlets like Spotlight PA often publish explainers on how to run for local
    office
    ([PA primary election 2025: How to run for local public office • Spotlight PA](https://www.spotlightpa.org/statecollege/2025/02/pennsylvania-municipal-primary-election-local-government-elected-officials-nomination-petitions/#:~:text=With%20the%20nomination%20petition%20window,local%20public%20office%20in%20Pennsylvania))
    ([PA primary election 2025: How to run for local public office • Spotlight PA](https://www.spotlightpa.org/statecollege/2025/02/pennsylvania-municipal-primary-election-local-government-elected-officials-nomination-petitions/#:~:text=Potential%20candidates%20can%20begin%20gathering,State%20also%20provides%20resources%20online)).
    Local newspapers or the City Paper may also run stories with practical info.
    These can complement official sources by providing tips or highlighting
    recent changes (for instance, a 2019 change reduced signature requirements
    for many local offices – media coverage can help clarify such updates).
  - **Mentors and Current Officeholders:** Don’t underestimate the value of
    speaking with current or former officeholders. A sitting Democratic
    councilmember or state rep (especially one not running against you) might be
    willing to share advice on campaigning, filing, and what pitfalls to avoid.
    Many were once in your shoes and can point you to reliable campaign
    attorneys or treasurers in the area.

Finally, ensure you comply with all legal and procedural requirements _while
also running a strong campaign_. Success in running for office as a Democrat in
Pittsburgh will come from a combination of meeting these official requirements
and connecting with voters on the issues. By knowing the rules, meeting the
deadlines, and utilizing party resources, you’ll put yourself in the best
position to compete. Good luck on your campaign!
