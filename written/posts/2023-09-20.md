# Exploring Go with CGO Overhead and `sqlc`

In a recent endeavor, I've been tinkering with building a server in Golang. It's
built around a low-level TCP protocol, each connection sparking its goroutine.
What makes this interesting is using cgo to interface with a library. As many
Golang fans might know, each cgo call incurs a time penalty due to the
transition from C to Go. This bridge had me curious - has this ever been a
performance bottleneck for others?

To paint a clearer picture, I stumbled upon
[Shane's article](https://shane.ai/posts/cgo-performance-in-go1.21/) discussing
the performance of CGO in Go 1.21. A quick synopsis: cgo calls roughly take
about 40ns – on par with the time `encoding/json` spends parsing a single-digit
integer. This performance scales with a core count of about 16 cores, after
which contention issues slow down the process. It's worth noting that while
Shane suggests cgo performance might be satisfactory, it's not a universal
endorsement of using cgo. A 20-core machine was his testing playground, after
all.

Jokes about nanosecond optimizations aside, I considered moving my inner loop to
Rust or C. If the ego boundary is crossed frequently, it's worth contemplating
the potential performance gains. Plus, learning Rust has been on my bucket list.

Another intriguing aspect of my journey was discovering that the library I'm
interfacing with might involve more than just one cgo call. Dive deeper? Well,
that's on my to-do list.

I also dabbled with the Go runtime settings in the name of optimization. I
naively considered setting `GOMAXPROCS=1` after removing a mutex, expecting Go's
runtime to ensure sequential operation. To my surprise, putting it to
`GOMAXPROCS=2` performed better. But, a word of caution: trusting the runtime as
its mutex beyond this point led to a drop in performance.

Integrating SQLite through the
[CGO library](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3) added another layer of depth
to my experiment. Here's the gist of my learnings:

- Using `db/sql`, you can open multiple database connections using a mutex.
- SQLite has distinct methods to lock files, transactions, and operations (using
  mutex).
- Setting the max open connections to 1 and modifying SQLite settings can boost
  performance by 2-3 times. However, you can't simultaneously access the
  database file with CLI SQLite3.

And for those curious about the code, feel free to dive into
[sqlettus on GitHub](https://github.com/jtarchie/sqlettus).

As the project evolved, my vision crystallized. The aim? Building something
compatible with the Redis protocol but backed by databases. Why? With its
transaction capabilities and established protocols, SQL is the perfect match.
Besides, being able to inspect your database through both SQL and the Redis
protocol has its perks.

Here's a sneak peek into my progress:

- Built a router to handle TCP directives.
- Emphasized handling tasks at the SQL level, harnessing `sqlc` to cut down on
  boilerplate (unearthed a few bugs in the process!).
- Continual refactoring to make adding directives a breeze.
- Hunting for a consistent pattern for various database backends.

As a bonus, I've received some great suggestions, like renaming it to
`sqlettuce.` And yes, spelling can be a challenging game!
