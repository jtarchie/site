# Deploying a Rails Application with AWS Copilot

This post outlines deploying a Rails application using AWS Copilot, a CLI tool
designed to provide a Heroku-like experience within the AWS ecosystem. Before
proceeding, it's recommended to familiarize yourself with the basics by
following the
["Deploy your first application"](https://aws.github.io/copilot-cli/docs/getting-started/first-app-tutorial/)
guide in the Copilot documentation.

I used the [Jumpstart Rails](https://jumpstartrails.com/) project template for
this deployment. The steps and configurations discussed here are specific to
this template but might be adaptable to other Rails applications.

**Important Notes:**

- Each `copilot` command executes CloudFormation operations in the background.
  Inspecting the CloudFormation Stacks in the AWS console can be insightful if
  you encounter issues.
- `copilot` commands can be time-consuming.

## Setting Up the Application

First, log into the AWS account and set up the application and environment using
the following commands:

```bash
# Log into the AWS account (using SSO for this deployment)
aws configure sso

# Initialize the application repository
copilot init \
  -a rails-app \
  -t "Load Balanced Web Service" \
  -n web \
  -d ./Dockerfile.production

# Create a test/development environment
copilot env init \
  --name dev \
  --app rails-app \
  --default-config
```

This step does not deploy the application but sets up the necessary
configuration within your repository's `copilot/` directory.

### Database Configuration

Next, allocate the database as a
[`storage`](https://aws.github.io/copilot-cli/docs/commands/storage-init/) unit:

```bash
copilot storage init \
  -n webdb \
  -t Aurora \
  -w web \
  -l environment \
  --engine PostgreSQL \
  --initial-db railsapp
```

For the application to access database credentials, modify the `manifest.yml`
file as follows:

```yaml
network:
  vpc:
    security_groups:
      - from_cfn: ${COPILOT_APPLICATION_NAME}-${COPILOT_ENVIRONMENT_NAME}-webdbSecurityGroup
secrets:
  DATABASE_JSON:
    from_cfn: ${COPILOT_APPLICATION_NAME}-${COPILOT_ENVIRONMENT_NAME}-webdbAuroraSecret
```

### Application Configuration

AWS provides `DATABASE_JSON` instead of the typical `DATABASE_URL`. Adjust the
`database.yml` to parse these credentials:

```yaml
production:
  <<: *default
  # Parse DATABASE_JSON if available
  <% if ENV['DATABASE_JSON'] %>
  <%   require 'json' %>
  <%   db_config = JSON.parse(ENV['DATABASE_JSON']) %>
  username: <%= db_config['username'] %>
  password: <%= db_config['password'] %>
  host: <%= db_config['host'] %>
  port: <%= db_config['port'] %>
  database: <%= db_config['dbname'] %>
  <% else %>
  url: <%= ENV['DATABASE_URL'] %>
  <% end %>
```

In your `Dockerfile.production`, include instructions for precompiling assets
and starting the Rails server:

```docker
RUN SECRET_KEY_BASE=dummy-staging-key bin/rails assets:precompile
CMD ["bin/rails", "server", "-b", "0.0.0.0"]
```

Set environment variables for production in your `manifest.yml`:

```yaml
variables:
  RAILS_ENV: production
  SECRET_KEY_BASE: <value from `rails secret`>
```

### Service Configuration

Configure the application as a
["Load Balanced Web Service"](https://aws.github.io/copilot-cli/docs/manifest/lb-web-service/)
to enable command execution in the container, essential for tasks like database
migration.

```yaml
exec: true
```

Define routing and health check settings:

```yaml
http:
  path: '/'
  healthcheck: '/up'
```

Since SSL support isn't provided by default, turn off SSL enforcement in
`config/environments/production.rb`:

```ruby
config.force_ssl = false
```

### Deploying the Application

Deploy the application and database using the following commands:

```bash
copilot deploy \
  --deploy-env \
  --env dev \
  --name web

# Run database migrations post-deployment
copilot svc exec \
  --command "bin/rails db:migrate" \
  -n web

# View application logs
copilot svc logs

# Display deployment information
copilot svc show
```

You should have a URL in the `show` command that will expose your app to the
public Internet.

We did it! We've deployed our application.

This has been the best application tool to deploy into the AWS ecosystem. This
is, however, the longest time it has taken me to deploy a hello world Rails
application with compromises -- i.e., SSL, one of the tasks, etc.

How can I help make this experience better for others after me? I have a blog
post to write about the incident. I do want the experience to be more flawless.
There are a lot of gothyas and "didn't you reads" that have been discoverable
but disappointing.

> Note: To clean it all up `copilot app delete`.

## Update

I was later informed via a
[chat thread](https://matrix.to/#/!QdxoBcgpJveoAoIPCc:gitter.im/$YqOcVQ2VqEqsXvDqEYeOsEOR-mp7HhDbLoBJCw67J8I?via=gitter.im&via=matrix.org&via=matrix.unope.ru)
with the team, that I can get SSL using `Request-Driven Web Service`.

```bash
copilot init \
  -a rails-app \
  -t "Request-Driven Web Service" \
  -n web \
  -d ./Dockerfile.production
```

The issue that I was running into of not being able database migrations can be
solved with
[`copilot task run`](https://aws.github.io/copilot-cli/docs/commands/task-run/).

```bash
copilot task run \
  --command "bin/rails db:migrate" \
  --dockerfile Dockerfile.production \
  --env dev \
  --app rails-app \
  --follow
```

However, I found a bug with `task run`. When it builds the docker image, it uses
the host architecture, it is not building for the target architecture. I changed
my command to use the latest image of the app I just deployed, using
`docker images`.

```bash
copilot task run \
  --command "bin/rails db:migrate" \
  --image <ecr host>/rails-app/web \
  --env dev \
  --app rails-app \
  --follow
```

This did not work because the `task run` does not assume the environment
variables and secrets from the services. This would include `RAILS_ENV` and the
`DATABASE_JSON`.

This does not appear to be a viable way for me.
