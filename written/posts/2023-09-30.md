# My Preferred Go Stack

A few weeks ago, a friend asked how I wrote code so swiftly. The secret isn't
maintaining a template repo but having a set of preferred libraries that
harmonize with my coding style. In this post, I will introduce you to these
libraries, sharing insights on their benefits and providing example code
snippets to illustrate their ease of use. I encourage you to explore the
extended documentation linked to understand each library's full scope and
capabilities.

- [`kong`](https://github.com/alecthomas/kong)

  Kong allows me to parse arguments into a struct, providing features like
  passing state to the executing command and supporting various arguments. Its
  command patterns facilitate the use of global options passed to subcommands.

  ```go
  package main

  type CLI struct {
    Filename *os.File `help:"the filename to write"`
    Write    bool     `help:"write something to the file"`
  }

  func (c *CLI) Run() error {
    if c.Write {
      _, err := c.Filename.Write([]byte("Hello World"))
      return err
    }
    return nil
  }

  func main() {
    cli := &builder.CLI{}
    ctx := kong.Parse(cli)
    err := ctx.Run()
    ctx.FatalIfErrorf(err)
  }
  ```

- [`req`](https://github.com/imroc/req)

  While Go does offer a HTTP client in its standard library, `req` eliminates
  the boilerplate that comes with it. It features middleware extension, a retry
  mechanism, and excellent defaults, such as timeouts, providing transparency in
  HTTP requests through its dead mode.

  ```go
  package main

  import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/imroc/req/v3"
  )

  func main() {
    client := req.C()
    resp, err := client.R().
      SetRetryCount(3).
      Get("https://httpbin.org/uuid")
    if err != nil {
      log.Fatal(err)
    }
    fmt.Println(resp)
  }
  ```

- [`echo`](https://github.com/labstack/echo)

  Its ability to handle routing and extend middleware, is invaluable for those
  coming from a full-stack background. It resembles Sinatra in Ruby and provides
  a meticulously documented, excellent routing system.

  ```go
  package main

  import (
    "github.com/labstack/echo/v4"
  )

  func main() {
    e := echo.New()
    e.GET("/hello", hello)
    e.Logger.Fatal(e.Start(":1323"))
  }

  func hello(c echo.Context) error {
    return c.String(http.StatusOK, "Hello, World!")
  }
  ```

- [`worker`](https://github.com/jtarchie/worker)

  This is my own creation to manage go routine pools and streamline parallel
  work, reducing the repetitive coding in starting a routine and having a sync
  wait group. It offers configurable go routines and a buffer channel to queue
  the work onto.

  ```go
  package main

  import (
    "github.com/jtarchie/worker"
  )

  func main() {
    pool := worker.New[int](10, 10, func(index, value int) {
      // Processing in the background here with the value
    })
    defer pool.Close()

    for i := 0; i < 100_000; i++ {
      w.Enqueue(i)
    }
  }
  ```

- [`sqlite3` driver](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3)

  SQLite integrates seamlessly and is robust, offering a reliable database
  schema and validation. Despite utilizing CGO, its seamless operation and
  built-in full text search make it indispensable.

  ```go
  package main

  import (
      "database/sql"
      "fmt"
      "log"
      _ "github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3"
  )

  func main() {
      db, err := sql.Open("sqlite3", "./test.db")
      if err != nil {
          log.Fatal(err)
      }
      defer db.Close()

      statement, _ := db.Prepare("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS people (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, firstname TEXT, lastname TEXT)")
      statement.Exec()

      res, _ := db.Exec("INSERT INTO people (firstname, lastname) VALUES (?, ?)", "John", "Doe")
      id, _ := res.LastInsertId()
      fmt.Println("Inserted Row ID:", id)
  }
  ```

- [`ginkgo`](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo)

  Ginkgo offers a structured, BDD-style TDD framework. It's readable and,
  combined with `gomega`, provides powerful assertion capabilities.

  ```go
  package main_test

  import (
      . "github.com/onsi/ginkgo"
      . "github.com/onsi/gomega"
  )

  var _ = Describe("Calculator", func() {
      Context("Addition", func() {
          It("should add two numbers", func() {
              Expect(1 + 1).To(Equal(2))
          })
      })
  })
  ```

- [`golangci-lint`](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint)

  This tool has significantly streamlined my coding process, GolangCI-Lint. My
  go-to tool for all things linting. GolangCI-Lint doesn't just stop at
  identifying issues; it extends its utility by offering auto-fixes for numerous
  detected problems, a feature that has proven invaluable time and again.

  Here’s a peek at my default configuration:

  ```yaml
  run:
    skip-files: []
  linters:
    enable-all: true
    disable:
    - depguard
    - exhaustruct
    - paralleltest
    - gomoddirectives
    - lll
    # linters deprecated
    - deadcode
    - exhaustivestruct
    - golint
    - ifshort
    - interfacer
    - nosnakecase
    - maligned
    - scopelint
    - structcheck
    - varcheck
  ```

  In this configuration, I've activated most linters while deactivating a few
  that didn't align well with my preferences. One particular linter, `errcheck`,
  stands out for its utility. It ensures that all returned errors are aptly
  checked with `if err != nil {}`, helping maintain the codebase's robustness.

- [`lo`](https://github.com/samber/lo)

  This is a utility library for managing different data types in Go. It uses
  generics, providing functions similar to those in Ruby’s enumerable library.

  ```go
  package main

  import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/samber/lo"
  )

  func main() {
    slice := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
    mappedSlice := lo.Map(slice, func(i int) int {
      return i * 10
    })
    
    fmt.Println(mappedSlice) // Prints: [10 20 30 40]
  }
  ```

- [`log/slog`](https://go.dev/blog/slog)

  This structured logger is a recent addition to the Go standard library,
  offering message and parameter logging with exceptional JSON output, enhancing
  the coding experience by providing structured, understandable logs.

I am grateful to the developers behind these incredible libraries for their
contribution to the Go community, making the developer experience more pleasant
and efficient.

Having a preferred set of libraries that align with your coding style can
significantly enhance your coding experience, streamline your workflow, and
increase productivity. Each library mentioned has its unique offerings and aids
in creating efficient and clean code. Whether you are a seasoned developer or a
beginner exploring the Go programming landscape, I hope you find these libraries
as helpful as mine.
