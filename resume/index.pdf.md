helped mentor engineers to be effective and happier team members.

### Pivotal Labs - _Software Engineer_ - **05/2010-02/2014**

and large enterprise clients. I have been a strong advocate in maintaining
Pivotal Labs' strong culture of pair programming, test-driven development, and
agile development practices to all projects.
