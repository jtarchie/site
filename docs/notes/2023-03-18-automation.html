Before diving into the core concept, I’d like to define and narrow down the idea of automation within software engineering.<p>Automation, in this context, refers to code created by programmers to simplify tasks. The users benefiting from this automation are the computer programs themselves. The platforms on which programmers automate tasks include development machines, CI/CD systems, cron jobs, and more. Typically, there is a trigger for the automated task, such as an updated file, a new version of a container, or the presence of a binary file. The job may involve security scanning, updating downstream dependencies, or sending Slack messages.<p>Automation complexity arises when scripts have interdependencies, often represented as a pipeline in a CI/CD system like GitHub Actions, GoCD, or Concourse. An example pipeline can be a new git commit that happened in the code base, tests need to run against the code, and when they pass, the code gets deployed into an environment, which has performance and end-to-end tests to make sure there was no regression. If anything fails in the pipeline, you can rerun any part of the pipeline just in case.<p>As a software engineer, I’ve established two ground rules around automation.<p>First, automate yourself out of a job, a mindset more than something precisely actionable. If you find yourself repeatedly performing a task that doesn’t require critical thinking but still consumes time, try to figure out how to automate it. For example, if you’re always responsible for deployments and it takes up a significant portion of your time, automate the process to free up your schedule.<p>My second rule for automation is only to automate things you can do manually. Many engineers, myself included, have fallen into the trap of automating a task before fully understanding the problem, leading to spectacular failures when there’s no manual fallback. To avoid this, ensure you know the commands and requirements for manually executing the automated task in emergencies.<p>Applying these two rules will help you identify the repetitive tasks you’re performing and automate them with confidence. Enabling you to share your understanding with team members and provide context.<p>I once worked on an application where our platform was a CI/CD system that allowed people to install and update a platform. We provided bundled scripts, which meant most users never saw the commands contained within the scripts. We embedded these scripts and commands in our documentation to maintain transparency, allowing users to run them from their development environment.<p>We wanted to prevent users from encountering issues when copying and pasting commands from the documentation, such as syntax errors or incorrect arguments. Applying the two rules ensured the commands worked manually and within our CI/CD system. First, we manually tested the commands before adding them to the documentation. Second, we used the bundled scripts in our CI/CD system to confirm they also worked there. This approach led to documentation with its own CI/CD, ensuring everything was valid and functional. It was an advantageous experience.<p>With any rules, there are always going to be edge cases. For example, there may be security constraints with running specific code. The condition requires that code be executed within a particular environment because the credentials and network access have been isolated. You’ll never be able to run this locally from your development machine.<p>Also, with manual and automated intervention, there will be times when you want to do something manually constantly. It could be for the satisfaction, validation, and verification that it Just Works™ correctly. It could also be that you are the only one that runs this. Where the line exists between automation and manual execution is a personal/team preference; just make sure to check yourself that your automation is not over-engineering a straightforward process.<p>In conclusion, automation in software engineering can be a powerful tool to save time, reduce human error, and streamline processes. By adhering to the two ground rules of automation and considering edge cases and personal/team preferences, you can create a robust automation system that benefits you and your team. Remember, automation aims to make life easier for you and your fellow engineers.</main>
