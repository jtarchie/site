<p>Dear Hiring Managers:</p>
<p>&lt; job description&gt;</p>
<p>I've been at Pivotal for 10+ years. This included working with
client engagements to build their applications. Using Rails and
Javascript, using TDD, pair programming, and Agile product
management. Having a process helps to build a product helps teams
streamline, focus, and align on sustainable deliverables.</p>
<p>For the past six years, I moved away from Rails to Golang and
distributed cloud systems. I learned to apply the same product
development methodologies in other business domains.</p>
<p>Validated!</p>
<p>I've been able to help rescue products, mentor new engineers
(❤️), and create balanced teams. I've been effective in building
and continuously delivering software in a corporate environment! I
grew to love CI/CD, so much that a personal motto is, "Automate
yourself out of a job."</p>
<p>I'm ready for my next challenge. I enjoy building products that
people enjoy using. I have the experience and toolset to provide
value to any team. And would appreciate working with like-minded
folks.</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>JT Archie</p>
