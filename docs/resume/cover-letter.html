My experience with enterprise customers has taught me the importance of having a process in place to streamline and align teams towards sustainable deliverables.<p>Mid-way through my career, I made a deliberate shift from full-stack web programming to backend distributed cloud systems. I have applied the same product development methodologies across different business domains, which has allowed me to feel comfortable rotating between different technology stacks.<p>I am proud of my ability to rescue products, mentor new engineers, and create balanced teams. I have a proven track record of delivering software in a corporate environment, and I am passionate about CI/CD, as my personal motto is, "Automate yourself out of a job."<p>I am eager for my next challenge and enjoy building products that people find useful. I believe my experience and toolset will add value to any team, and I am looking forward to working with like-minded individuals.<p>Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications in further detail.<p>Kind Regards,<p>JT Archie</main>
