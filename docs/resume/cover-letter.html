This included working with client engagements to build their applications. Using Rails and Javascript, using TDD, pair programming, and Agile product management. Having a process helps to build a product helps teams streamline, focus, and align on sustainable deliverables.<p>For the past six years, I moved away from Rails to Golang and distributed cloud systems. I learned to apply the same product development methodologies in other business domains.<p>Validated!<p>I’ve been able to help rescue products, mentor new engineers (❤️), and create balanced teams. I’ve been effective in building and continuously delivering software in a corporate environment! I grew to love CI/CD, so much that a personal motto is, “Automate yourself out of a job.”<p>I’m ready for my next challenge. I enjoy building products that people enjoy using. I have the experience and toolset to provide value to any team. And would appreciate working with like-minded folks.<p>Thank you for your consideration.<p>Kind Regards,<p>JT Archie</main>
