Tests are another interface just for the developers.</blockquote><p>Tests provide the developers confidence that things are working the way they should.<h2 id="what-does-it-mean-to-be-red-then-green">What does it mean to be red then green?</h2><p>I always remember “red, green, then refactor” when I write a test.<ol><li><p>Red<p>An assertion (in the test) was made on the code’s behavior. It is failing on an assertion test.<li><p>Green<p>Write the code to make that tests pass. Now you have something in a working state. Commit it!<li><p>Refactor<p>Now that you know things are in a working and deliverable state, can you refactor your code?</ol><p>Do you need to do this each time? No.<p>It helps me narrow down the scope of a test and have a criteria for when I am <em>done</em> with it.<h2 id="is-your-test-testing-just-your-test-or-your-code">Is your test testing just your test or your code?</h2><p>Imagine this a situation while programming.<p>There is a test, some code was written, and everything is green. Someone comes back, edits some code, all the tests are still green.<p>This is great! Tests should have to change with a different implementation of code, just as long as the assertions of the behavior is the same.<p>When you comment out your code, your test should fail. Yet it is still passing. Why is that?<p>Sometimes our tests are just testing our tests, not our code. Ee might be testing a mock implementation of something.<p>Tests should fail when I comment out the code I believe to be testings. It may not be the tests I wrote, but something should break, so we know something changed.<h2 id="how-do-you-start-writing-tests">How do you start writing tests?</h2><p>When writing tests, I like to think of the happy path first, “If everything was working perfectly, what would I expect to happen?” Allowing you to write tests free from the distractions of errors and side effects. It can help with test setup the behavior you want the tests.<p>The next step is a sad path – errors, side effects, and other paths. For example, “If we cannot connect to the API, what should we do?” It helps test the <em>branching</em> (conditions) of your code.<p>Thinking about your tests in discrete chunks will help produce understandable tests. Tests are another means to document your code, similar to commenting.</main>
