Tests are another interface just for the developers." Tests provide the developers confidence that things are working the way they should.<blockquote><p>What does it mean to be red then green?</blockquote><p>I always remember "red, green, then refactor" when I write a test.<ol><li>Red -- An assertion (in the test) was made on the code's behavior, failing.<li>Green -- Write the code to make that tests pass. Now you have something in a working state. Commit it!<li>Refactor -- Now that you know things are in a working and deliverable state, can you refactor your code?</ol><p>Do you need to do this each time? No.<p>It is helpful for me. It helps me narrow down the scope of a test and have a criteria for when I am <em>done</em> with it.<blockquote><p>Is your test testing just your test or your code?</blockquote><p>We are setting up a situation.<p>There is a test, some code was written, and everything is green. Someone comes back, edits some code, all the tests are still green.<p>In practice, this is great. Tests should have to change with a different implementation of code, just as long as the assertions of the behavior is the same.<p>If you comment out your code, what happens? Your test should fail. But it might be passing, too. Why is that?<p>Sometimes our tests are just testing our tests, not our code. For example, we might be testing a mock implementation of something.<p>I think about it this way. I expect some tests to fail when I comment out this code. It may not be the tests I wrote, but something should break, so we know something changed.<p>When writing tests, I like to think of the happy path first, "If everything was working perfectly, what would I expect to happen?" Allowing you to write tests free from the distractions of errors and side effects. It can help with test setup the behavior you want the tests.<p>The next step is a sad path -- errors, side effects, and other paths. For example, "If we cannot connect to the API, what should we do?" It helps test the <em>branching</em> (conditions) of your code.</main><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prettify/r298/run_prettify.min.js" integrity="sha512-MFn8OyBl1+xHPFpbyXJjYrUFSPOIznR5zo8sBN6eSF35K/F/PqSo3EqFfXHqhMzhQdr8z6dMsCEyIjDjBPy+4w==" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
