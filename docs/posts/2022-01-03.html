Since I used to live there, this has been my list of things to do and try.<ul><li>🛣Coastal Highway 101, drive it from Carlsbad down to San Diego.<li>Drive to Torrey Pines, both South and North. It is just beautiful.</ul><h2 id="downtown">Downtown</h2><ul><li>🍩<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/TvzidGvVLwUQhqZP7">Donut Bar</a> is excellent. I love donuts and this place has never done wrong in providing something unique.<li>🥮<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Am2HRpEPFyjPaRDMA">Extraordinary Desserts</a> has a menu of just desserts. You may see a pattern here.<li>🌻<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/MA8FzMjvaGviTr3E7">Balboa Park</a> is a beautiful botanical park. You can spend a day here, between the museums and gardens.<li>🦓<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/nGLYh58XAgr1vEz49">San Diego Zoo</a> is the world-famous Zoo. Huge! All the animals! And located in Balboa Park.</ul><h2 id="breweries-">Breweries 🍺🍻</h2><p>This deserved its own section. These breweries are spread amongst San Diego. Always ask the brewer/tender where to go next, they know more.<ul><li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/7XzSgLuQBasaRmXT8">Modern Times</a> great experimental brewery. They just have something clever on tap. Similar to Something Brewery in Brighton.<li>Stone runs <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Nf6BUG6zVCkHzRsD8">Stone Gardens</a> Brewing. They have great location downtown and some of the best IPAs ever.<li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/heg97DFVNgmSAnPv6">Resident Brewing</a> has a great downtown SD location.</ul><h2 id="pacific-beach-pb-️">Pacific Beach (PB) 🏴‍☠️</h2><p>A surf “college” town, but lots of food, drinks, etc. Grand Ave is the “main street”, but the beauty of PB is the beach.<p>Fact: You used to be able to drink on the beach (like with kegs), until 2007 where the fight between July 4th beach party-goers and Police broke out.<ul><li>🍔<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/MJQfYwVKPjtzzv8s6">Kono’s Cafe</a> is a “Hawaiian” breakfast spot. It is delicious and a tried-and-true hangover recovery area. It is also at the start of the PB boardwalk.<li>PB Boardwalk, rent a bike (or bring one) and ride up and down. There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn87-mcnoVc">characters</a> along here, but it can be very entertaining.<li>🏄‍♀️<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/uxWHo1LG4rVdkQUS9">Mission Beach Surfing</a> is where I learned to surf. Every one fun and friendly. The water will be cold, it is the Pacific.<li>🖼<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/FHetyMe9iQRXRPmx6">Green Flash Art</a> is a piece made to represent the sunset. The lore of it, when looking at the sunset, you see a green flash amongst the orange and red at the very end of it.<li><a href="https://g.page/figtreecafe-pacific-beach?share">Fig Tree Cafe</a> is a classic hipster brunch – french toast, omelets, etc. Nothing will be deconstructed, though.</ul><h2 id="solana-beach">Solana Beach</h2><p>Standard beach-side town. Easily drive-through but a good place to stop.<ul><li>🍕&🍺<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/HxM7Pb6ykJCVS7rP9">Pizza Port</a> is a brewery and pizzeria. The best (maybe just nostalgic). My go-to here was the Shark Bite Red Ale with BBQ Chicken, bacon, and pineapple (don’t judge) pizza.<li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/sPAGwVtcoskKxLv38">Chart House</a> for the best seafood. It is a swanky place, but worth it. They have a sister place across the street, but I don’t see it anymore.</ul><h2 id="encinitas">Encinitas</h2><p>This is a classic surf-side town. Tony Hawk is from here!<ul><li>👓<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/95hpuTou61oHanRZA">Swamis</a> is a surf beach. If you are here on a big wave day, you will see some of the best surfers in the world. Go early in the morning, grab a cup of coffee, and enjoy.<li>☕️<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/wKXv6DKMjewZFPtj7">Lofty Coffee</a> grab a coffee here, take it to Swamis.<li>🌯<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/qjfzcQMDqy2tDEFcA">Filberto’s</a> for a burrito. It is open 24/7, may not be the best, but always accessible.</ul><h2 id="del-mar">Del Mar</h2><p>Just park and walk around.<ul><li>🥪<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/CPRG135MeifmKCNz9">Board and Brew</a> is a sandwich shop. Get the chicken club with the Sweet & Sour dipping sauce. Ask for the sauce during purchase, it is not on the menu!<li>🌅<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/9DvUJR158xnmUYKKA">Seagrove Park</a> watch the sunset here one night. Just do it!<li>🌮<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/THKXwrf5fNkySaAa9">Roberto’s</a> is the taco place that Blink 182 sang about. Order the fish and shrimp tacos with chips and guac. Sit outside and enjoy the cove.</ul><h2 id="la-jolla">La Jolla</h2><p>La Jolla is like Cherry Creek (with Boulder) on the beach. Expensive and beautiful houses everywhere.<ul><li>🐋<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/qJ6MK2BTvv9FwWhq9">Seal Rock</a> you can view seals are hanging out and sleeping on rocks.<li>🐡<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/aMMKYa7Wv7tY8WA9A">Birch Aquarium</a> is by far the best aquarium I’ve been to. It is huge!</ul><h2 id="hillcrest-️">Hillcrest 🏳️‍🌈</h2><p>This is the most excellent neighborhood downtown. Stay here. Coffee shops, restaurants, etc. This place has grown so much, and I couldn’t tell you what’s there anymore.<h2 id="old-town-">Old Town 🇲🇽</h2><p>Tourist trap of an <em>authenticate</em> Mexican town. I don’t recall this being worth it.</main>
