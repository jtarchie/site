And located in Balboa Park.</ul><h2 id="breweries">Breweries 🍺🍻</h2><p>This deserved its own section. These breweries are spread amongst San Diego. Always ask the brewer/tender where to go next, they know more.<ul><li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/7XzSgLuQBasaRmXT8">Modern Times</a> great experimental brewery. They just have something clever on tap. Similar to Something Brewery in Brighton.<li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Nf6BUG6zVCkHzRsD8">Stone Gardens</a> is run by Stone Brewing.

It is delicious and a tried-and-true hangover recovery area. It is also at the start of the PB boardwalk.<li>PB Boardwalk, rent a bike (or bring one) and ride up and down. There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn87-mcnoVc">characters</a> along here, but it can be very entertaining.<li>🏄‍♀️<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/uxWHo1LG4rVdkQUS9">Mission Beach Surfing</a> is where I learned to surf.

Easily drive through, but good place to stop.<ul><li>🍕&🍺<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/HxM7Pb6ykJCVS7rP9">Pizza Port</a> is a brewery and pizzeria. The best (maybe just nostalgic). My go to here was the Shark Bite Red Ale with BBQ Chicken, bacon, and pineapple (don't judge) pizza.<li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/sPAGwVtcoskKxLv38">Chart House</a> for the best seafood. It is a swainky place, but worth it. They use to have a sister place across the street, but I don't see it anymore.</ul><h2 id="encinitas">Encinitas</h2><p>This is a classic surf-side town. Tony Hawk is from here!<ul><li>👓<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/95hpuTou61oHanRZA">Swamis</a> is a surf beach. If you are here on a big wave day, you will see some of the best surfers in the world.

Just do it!<li>🌮<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/THKXwrf5fNkySaAa9">Roberto's</a> is the taco place that Blink 182 sang about. Order the fish and shrimp tacos with chips and guac.
