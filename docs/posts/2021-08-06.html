Figuring out what you are building and when you can deliver those features. Optimally, the team keeps up the velocity of delivery indefinitely.<p>As an engineer, as you've been delivering, something irks you. Features start to become harder to bear. There's a refactoring you've been neglecting. Then it occurs, you cannot keep delivering as you once were.<p>You've reached the imaginary line of technical debt.<p>Often we'll look for a scapegoat.<ul><li>A former engineer that used to be on the team.<li>Too much work and not enough time because leaders have a deadline<li>The one I dread hearing the most is, "The product manager won't let me."</ul><p>I assure you, it is your fault. A product manager has never looked over your shoulder or pull request and said, "You can not do tech debt, now."<p>Technical debt is the symptom of a team not able to prioritize. Your team needs to have space for prioritizing its needs. Some things are necessary to complete, but others are not. The key is to focus on the essential things, the necessities.<p>A product manager will always say, "Let's deliver features. How do we get there?" How engineering achieves this is up to them. Don't add the different and unrealistic expectations. The product manager is on your team to achieve the same goals. Please include them in your mindset and process. Don't demonize somebody for any failure of the group. Work with them to improve and resolve it.<p>Tech debt is an unapproachable thing. We've accepted that we won't ever have a finished product but will iterate over it with product delivery. Tech debt still is this bucket of "it'll never be finished, so save it for <em>later</em>". We need to refrain from this phrase not to have a negative connotation.<p>We need to be better gardeners — code is the garden. If we prune, replant, etc., the garden will grow into something lovely. There is no such thing as a hack-day for a gardener because it would be inefficient for the long-term curation of the garden.<p>When you become a gardener, maintaining code is becomes a consistent process. Doing it as part of the development process means you are always thinking about it.</main><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prettify/r298/run_prettify.min.js" integrity="sha512-MFn8OyBl1+xHPFpbyXJjYrUFSPOIznR5zo8sBN6eSF35K/F/PqSo3EqFfXHqhMzhQdr8z6dMsCEyIjDjBPy+4w==" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
