Figuring out what you are building and when can you deliver those features. Optimally, the team keeps up the velocity of delivery indefinitely.<p>As an engineer, as you've been delivering, something irks you. Features start to become harder to deliver. There’s a refactoring you’ve been neglecting. Then it occurs, you cannot keep delivering as you once were.<p>You’ve reached the imaginary line of technical debt.<p>Often we’ll look for a scapegoat.<ul><li>A former engineer that used to be on the team.<li>Too much work and not enough time because leaders have a deadline<li>The one I dread hearing the most is, "The product manager won’t let me."</ul><p>I assure you, it is your fault. A product manager has never looked over your shoulder or pull request and said, "You can not do tech debt, now."<p>Technical debt is the symptom of a team that not able to prioritize. Your team needs to have space for prioritizing its needs. Some things are necessary to complete, but others are not. The key is to focus on the important things, the necessities. Knowing that everything is polished helps, but never actually finishing the work is detrimental to a team's ability to deliver.<p>A product manager will always say, "Let's delivery features. How do we get there?" How engineering achieves this is up to them. Don't add the additional and unrealistic expectations. The product manager is on your team, trying to achieve the same goals. Include them in your mindset and process. Don't demonize somebody for any failing of the team. Work with them to improve and resolve it.<p>Tech debt is an unapproachable thing. With product delivery, we've accepted that we won’t ever have a finished product, but will iterate over it. Tech debt still is this bucket of "it’ll never be finished, so save it for <em>later</em>". We need to refrain from this phrase to not have the negative connotation it has.<p>We need to be better gardeners — code is the garden. If we prune, replant, etc. the garden will grow into something nice. It has to be done while gardening, though. Not at one big "you’ll have a hack day for tech debt" kind of way.<p>When you become a gardener, the practice of maintaining code because a consistent process. Doing it as part of the development process means you are always thinking about it.</main><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prettify/r298/run_prettify.min.js" integrity="sha512-MFn8OyBl1+xHPFpbyXJjYrUFSPOIznR5zo8sBN6eSF35K/F/PqSo3EqFfXHqhMzhQdr8z6dMsCEyIjDjBPy+4w==" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
