Figuring out what you are building and when can you deliver those features. Optmially, the team keeps up the velocity of delivery indefinetly.<p>As an engineer, as you've been delivering, something irks you. Features start become harder to deliver. There’s an refactoring you’ve been neglecting. Then it occurs, you cannot keep delivering as you once were.<p>You’ve reach the imaginary line of technical debt.<p>Often we’ll look for scapegoat.<ul><li>A former engineer that use to be on the team.<li>Too much work and not enough time because leaders have a deadline<li>The one I dread hearing the most, “The product manager won’t let me.”</ul><p>I assure you, it is your fault. A product manager has never looked over your shoulder or pull request and said, “You do tech debt, now.” It is your fault, but it is OK.<p>Tech debt is an unapproachable thing. With product delivery, we've accepted that we won’t ever have a finished product, but will iterate over it. Tech debt still is this bucket of “it’ll never be finished, so save it for <em>later</em>”. We need to refrain from this phrase to not have the negative connotation it has.<p>We need to be better gardeners — code is the garden. If we prune, replant, etc. the garden will grown into something nice. It has to be done while gardening, though. Not at one big “you’ll have a hack day for tech debt” kind of way.</main><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prettify/r298/run_prettify.min.js" integrity="sha512-MFn8OyBl1+xHPFpbyXJjYrUFSPOIznR5zo8sBN6eSF35K/F/PqSo3EqFfXHqhMzhQdr8z6dMsCEyIjDjBPy+4w==" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
