# About

Hi :wave:! I'm JT.

I'm a friend, programmer, mentor, and over-lander. I've been an ultra runner
:running:, salsa dancer :dancer:, and beer reviewer :beer:.

As a programmer, I've learned to tinker, reverse engineer, team building, and
product design. I want to capture what I've learned, so it can be shared.

# Blog

Sometimes I write things. These are the latest posts from blog.

<% posts.take(3).each do |doc| %>

- [<%= doc.title %>](%= doc.path %) <% end %>

Read the [all the entries](/posts).

# Work

I love working with people to build better teams and products. The next goal is
to have a bespoke software shop.

## Contact

I always appreciate face-to-face speaking, but video chat is comfortable
compromise. If you're interested in working with me, let's
<a href="mailto:hello2022@jtarchie.com">talk</a>. We can discuss everything from
a full-time job, consulting, or just catch up.

This is my resume provided in different formats.
