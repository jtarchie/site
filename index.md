# About

Hi :wave:! I'm JT.

I'm a friend, programmer, mentor, and over-lander.
I've been an ultra runner :running:, salsa dancer :dancer:, and beer reviewer :beer:.

As a programmer, 
I've learned to tinker, reverse engineer, team building, and product design.
I want to capture what I've learned.

# Blog

Sometimes I write things.
These are the latest posts from blog.

<% posts.take(3).each do |doc| %>
* [<%= doc.title %>](<%= doc.path %>)
<% end %>

# Work

I love working with people to build better teams and products.


## Contact

I always appreciate face-to-face speaking,
but video chat is comfortable compromise.

let's <a href="mailto:hello2022@jtarchie.com">talk</a>.
We can discuss everything from a
full-time job,
consulting,
or just catch up.
