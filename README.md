# Introduction

This is the personal website of me (JT). Like many websites, this has been a
work in progress, I just never added the "Under Construction" gif (like JIF).

The writing on this site our my own. Please visit https://jtarchie.com for the
most up to date content. This `README.md` will be pretty sparse.

## Usage

This site uses my personal site tool called
[builder](https://github.com/jtarchie.builder).

The following instructions were built for Mac OS.

```bash
brew bundle
# make changes in posts
task # view at http://localhost:8080
```

When I am satisfied with the changes:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m 'helpful message'
git push
```

The deployment of the pages is done via Github Actions.
